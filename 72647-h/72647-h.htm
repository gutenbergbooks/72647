<p>When he died in 1936 Charles Sears Baldwin, Professor
of Rhetoric and English Composition at
Columbia University, left the unpublished manuscript
which here appears in print. At the request of his family,
I undertook to prepare the manuscript for publication and
see it through the press. As a devoted student, colleague,
and friend I have been happy to do so.</p>

<p>Baldwin’s <i>Renaissance Literary Theory and Practice</i>
takes its place as the continuation of his previously
published studies: <i>Ancient Rhetoric and Poetic</i> (1924)
and <i>Medieval Rhetoric and Poetic</i> (1928), both published
by the Macmillan Company. It takes up the story where
<i>Medieval Rhetoric and Poetic</i> left off in 1400 and carries
it on to 1600.</p>

<p>The first sentences of his preface to the first study
suggest that Baldwin had the present study in mind before
1924. “To interpret ancient rhetoric and poetic afresh
from typical theory and practice is the first step toward
interpreting those traditions of criticism which were most
influential in the Middle Age. Medieval rhetoric and
poetic, in turn, prepare for a clearer comprehension of
the Renaissance renewal of allegiance to antiquity.”</p>

<p>Like the two earlier studies, it is firmly based on the
Aristotelian philosophy of composition embodied in the
<i>Rhetoric</i> and the <i>Poetic</i>. Baldwin adheres to the sound
rhetoric which aims at enhancing the subject and repudiates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
the sophistic rhetoric which aims at enhancing the
speaker. Rhetoric and poetic are different in aim and
different in their modes of composition. Consequently he
considers poetic deviated when it becomes confused with
rhetoric and perverted when controlled by sophistic.</p>

<p>Had he lived, Baldwin would have written more than
here appears. He had planned a chapter on Renaissance
education which would have demonstrated more fully
the channels through which poetical theory reached
poetical practice. In the chapter “Sixteenth Century
Poetics” he had planned sections on Castelvetro and
Sibillet which were never written. Other writers on
literary theory he deliberately omitted as less typical, less
significant, or less influential than the writers he discusses.
His method was to go directly to the original sources, both
for theory and for practice, to make his own translations,
and to ignore secondary sources, which he rarely cites.</p>

<p>Although Chapters IV, V, VI, and VIII deal with
literary forms: lyric, pastoral, romance, drama, tales, history,
and essay, Baldwin was not attempting a history of
Italian, French, and English literature in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries. To have written such a history would
have involved a completeness he never intended. He was
assaying samples of literature for literary values. Especially
was he tracing the influences of sound literary
theory on sound literary practice, and the disastrous results
in literature of the misapplication of rhetorical theory to
poetic and the composition of story and drama. As
literary critic and teacher of composition, he saw no good
reason why modern literature, in theory or in practice,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
should make the same mistakes that were made in ancient
times, the Middle Age, and the Renaissance. He believed
that modern literature, modern criticism, and modern
teaching should learn from the mistakes of others as well
as from their own.</p>

<p>Before Baldwin’s death I had read the manuscript in
two states as I had the two earlier works. Further, the
manuscript was read and criticized by Dr. Caroline Ruutz-Rees
of Rosemary Hall and Professor William G. Crane
of The College of the City of New York. To these
friends, and to the others whose aid I have been unable
to discover, the author’s and the editor’s gratitude is due.
Professor Marshall Whithed Baldwin, son of Charles
Sears Baldwin, read both the galley and the page proofs.
My colleagues, Professors Harry Morgan Ayres and
Nelson Glenn McCrea, advised on the proofs and other
details. I join with the Baldwin estate in gratitude to the
generous assistance of the officers and editorial staff of
the Columbia University Press.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE RENAISSANCE AS A LITERARY PERIOD</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The word <i>renaissance</i> suggests a state of mind, the
sense of recovering something neglected by one’s
literary ancestors. “Ours is a new day,” says the fifteenth
century. “We have escaped from the decadence of our
fathers into the purer poetry. We have recovered the great
tradition and are setting it forward.” So the English
eighteenth century, which had again repudiated “gothic
night,” was in turn repudiated in the manifesto of the
<i>Lyrical Ballads</i> and scorned by Keats as “a schism nourished
in foppery and barbarism.” <i>The</i> Renaissance, then,
is it only one such instance of self-consciousness among
the many that mark so-called periods of literature? The
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were regarded not only
at the time, but long and widely, as an actual new day,
<i>the</i> Renaissance. Histories of literature, no less than those
of politics and society, have treated it as a distinct period.
Though more recent histories have found it less distinct,
it still claims attention as a widespread cult of the ancient
classics. Its leading ideas permeated western Europe; and
its new day, though it was bent toward nationalism, was
conceived but secondarily as national progress, primarily
as a general reanimation from ancient ideals long neglected.
Thus it is not only the most familiar example of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
typical recurrence in literary history; it remains the cardinal
experience of classicism. Though we may no longer
speak of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as a reawakening
of literature equal to that of painting, we may still
speak of <i>the</i> Renaissance.</p>

<p>The common sixteenth-century view of accomplished
restoration after medieval decadence is expressed (1527)
by Guillaume Budé.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The best part, I think, we now have in our hands, saved from
the deluge of more than a thousand years; for a deluge indeed,
calamitous to life, had so drained and absorbed literature
itself and the kindred arts worthy of the name, and kept them
so dismantled and buried in barbarian mud that it was a
wonder they could still exist (<i>De studio literarum</i>, 1527; Basel
ed. 1533).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In 1558 the sober Minturno is merely less certain as to
dates.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">For who of you is unaware that from the time when the
Roman Empire, for all its power and eminence, began to totter
and lean, literature was asleep, not to say overwhelmed and
buried, till the time of Petrarch? From then on, it has been
so steadily regaining the light that now it has been almost
recalled from that [medieval] rude and barbarous teaching
to its ancient cult (<i>De poeta</i>, 1559, p. 14).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The <i>Poetica</i> (1561) of Julius Caesar Scaliger surprised
no one by bringing the history of Latin poetry to date
without even mentioning the Middle Age. He might
include his own poems; he need not include the medieval
hymns. Scorn of the Middle Age was a Renaissance literary
commonplace. The history of literature has to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
rewritten from age to age, first to satisfy such prejudices,
then to dispel them. The art that survives these reinterpretations,
the books or the paintings that still compel
admiration and study, are vindicated, whatever their
period, as classics. Meantime the perception of these has
been repeatedly obscured both by preoccupation with some
idealized great period and by pride in one’s own time.</p>

<p>What, then, has the longer perspective of history shown
to be the literary progress of the Middle Age and the distinctive
direction of the Renaissance? Two answers have
been found in the fourteenth-century borderland: (1)
the culmination of medieval development in the literary
triumph of the vernaculars, and (2) the beginning of a
new literary influence in the revival of Greek. Two more
belong to the fifteenth century: (3) the vogue of that
humanistic Latin which rejected the medieval freedom
for conformity to the style of an idealized great period,
and (4) the establishment of printing.</p>

<p>The literary triumph of the vernaculars is forecast in
Dante. The supreme achievement of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>
is eloquent at once of the Middle Age and of the
literary future. The vogue of Boccaccio and the wider
influence of Petrarch were not of their Latin, but of their
vernacular writings. The traditional superiority of Latin,
indeed, as the language of literature not only lingered; it
was upheld by humanism; but the tradition had gradually
to yield to the facts. The fourteenth century closed with
the convincing achievement of Chaucer in English. To
French also, though individual eminence was less, the
century promised the literary future. The long medieval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
course of Latin had reached its term. The new literary day
was for the new languages. None the less that new day
was medieval, not merely in date, but in being the culmination
of a medieval progress. The language of literature,
medieval experience had learned, must be the
language of communication. So it had long been in Latin;
so it had become, within medieval conditions, in Tuscan,
French, and English. No subsequent change through
Greek, or humanistic Latin, or even printing, more affected
the outlook and direction of literature than the
medieval rise of the vernaculars from literary acceptance
to literary eminence.</p>

<p>Greek, generally in abeyance through most of the
Middle Age, was studied by both Petrarch and Boccaccio
and had its professor at Florence in 1396. Its spread in
the fifteenth century was stimulated both by the movement
for the reunion of the “Greek” Church with Rome and by
the influx of Greek scholars after the fall of Constantinople
in 1453. But it never threatened the traditional
eminence of Latin. Renaissance literary dialogues were
less often Platonic in form than Ciceronian; and the direct
influence of Theocritus on revived pastoral is hard to distinguish
from the indirect influence through the <i>Bucolics</i>
of Vergil. Still more important to remember is that Greek
influence, direct or indirect, stopped short of Greek composition.
Greek dramaturgy, perhaps the cardinal Greek
influence on later times, remained ineffective in the Renaissance.
The <i>Poetic</i> of Aristotle did not oust the “Ars
poetica” of Horace. Slowly grasped, Greek dramaturgy
hardly shaped plays before the seventeenth century. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
sixteenth century was still repeating Horace and following
Seneca or carrying on the experience of the miracle plays
or learning by stage experiment. Nor was verse narrative,
even when called epic, attentive to the Aristotelian doctrine
of sequence. The integration of Tasso’s <i>Jerusalem</i>,
which found its model in the <i>Aeneid</i>, is quite exceptional.
The manuscripts circulating in the fourteenth century and
the early fifteenth, as well as the texts later printed, show
as ready a welcome for the decadent Greek literature of
Alexandria as for the great names of Athens. With
Homer came in not only the <i>Anthology</i>, but even those
“Greek romances” which are aggregations of melodrama.
The Renaissance vogue of Plato involved from its beginning
the cultivation of the neo-Platonists. On the other
hand, Greek added to higher education a language experience
that held its place for some three hundred years and
was expected of all scholars.</p>

<p>Renaissance scorn of the Middle Age was not merely
a general complacency; it was especially a repudiation of
the freedom of medieval Latin. Latin style must conform
to the habits of its great period; and this restoration was
a prime object of Renaissance classicism. In 1472 Guillaume
Fichet, scholar and rhetorician, wrote to another
rhetorician, Robert Gaguin:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">I feel the greatest satisfaction, most learned Robert, in the
flourishing here at Paris, where they used to be unknown, of
poetic compositions and all the parts of eloquence. For when in
my youth I first left the Baux country to study at Paris the
learning of Aristotle, I used to be much astonished at finding
so rarely in all Paris an orator and a poet. No one was studying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Cicero night and day as many do now. No one knew how
to write verse correctly or to scan the verse of others. For the
school of Paris, having lost the habit of Latinity, had hardly
emerged from ignorance in the field of discourse. But from
our days dates a better epoch; for the gods, to speak poetically,
and the goddesses are reviving among us the art of speaking
well.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In 1476 Lorenzo Valla prefaced a manual widely current
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, <i>De elegantia
linguae latinae</i>, with his shame at medieval Latin and his
confidence in the restoration.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">But as I would say more, I am choked and inflamed by grief,
compelled to weep as I behold from what estate and to what
estate eloquence has fallen. For what lover of letters or of the
public weal could restrain his tears at seeing it debased as
when Rome was captured by the Gauls: everything so overturned,
burned, dislocated that hardly survives even the very
citadel? These many centuries not only has no one spoken
Latin aright, but no one reading it has understood; the books
of the ancients have not been grasped and are not grasped
now; as if with the loss of the Roman Empire had been lost
all pride in speaking and knowing Roman, and the splendor
of Latinity, faded by mould and rust, were forgotten.... But
the less happy were those former times which produced no
single scholar, the more we may congratulate our own times,
in which, if we but strive a little further, I am confident that
not only the Roman city, but still more the Roman language,
and with it all liberal studies, shall be restored.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The Middle Age, then, could not write Latin. Not John
of Salisbury, not Dante, not even Aquinas was really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
<i>eruditus</i>! Fifty years later the judicious Bembo reports the
restoration as accomplished.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Latin has so far been purged of the rust of the untaught
centuries that today it has regained its ancient splendor and
charm.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Renaissance classicism thus ignored the medieval Latin
progress. This deliberate breaking with the past could
not, indeed, stop the sun; but it did put back the hands of
the clock. The humanistic cult of Augustan Latin as a
literary norm widely affected all language study. Though
its literary achievement has faded in the perspective of
history, its literary experience has permanent significance.</p>

<p>The rapid diffusion of printing in the late fifteenth
century was a change of so wide and deep consequence to
literature as to become a revolution. The suddenly increased
and rapidly increasing availability of books was
by itself enough to make a renaissance. Further it gave
their role to the great publishers: Aldus, Gryphius, the
Juntas, Froben, the Étiennes, Plantin. But one of the first
effects of printing was to prolong or widen the influence
of books characteristically medieval: Boethius and Bede,
Alain de Lille, Aquinas, Hugh of St Victor. With
Geoffrey of Monmouth were printed such romances as
<i>Mélusine</i> and <i>Pontus and the Fair Sidoine</i>. Even Merlin
was resuscitated. Neither Ariosto for his Carolingians nor
Spenser for his Arthurians needed manuscript sources.
Moreover the presses answered continuing demand for
the <i>Golden Legend</i> and for such typically medieval compends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
as that of Petrus Comestor, the <i>Speculum</i> of
Vincent of Beauvais, and even the <i>Etymologiae</i> of Isidore.
They brought out not only the greater Cicero, recovered
in 1422, but also the elder Seneca, Lucan, Aulus Gellius,
Statius, Ausonius, Claudian, Sidonius, the medieval favorites.
They multiplied for schools Donatus and Priscian,
Diomedes and Martianus Capella. The collection entitled
<i>Auctores</i> (or <i>Actores</i>) <i>octo</i> set before boys the <i>De contemptu
mundi</i>, the <i>Tobias</i> of Matthieu de Vendôme, an
<i>Isopet</i> and <i>Cathonet</i>, and the <i>Proverbia</i> of Alain de Lille.
The hackneyed <i>De inventione</i>, the <i>Rhetorica ad Herennium</i>,
and the hardy perennial “Ars poetica” of Horace
had new lease of life. Medieval courtly verse forms,
especially the <i>balade</i>, though scorned by Du Bellay and
Ronsard, persisted not only with Villon, but in the huge
printed collection of 1501, <i>Le Jardin de plaisance</i>. One
of the first effects of printing was to prolong the Middle
Age.</p>

<p>If the recovery of Greek, then, and even the establishment
of printing, did not upset historical continuity, what
of the lapse of feudalism? The most picturesque scene of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was such a ducal
court as that of Urbino, Mantua, or Ferrara. Its lavish
splendor broke from the ruins of feudalism. It was a
triumph of individual violence amid the dislocation of
medieval loyalties. This type of court, established and
maintained by such professional soldiers as Sir John
Hawkwood, became in Elizabethan imaginations a proverb
at once of magnificence and of ruthlessness. Macchiavelli’s
realistic statesmanship was interpreted as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
diabolic; and Italian dukes were staged with daggers and
poison. Though this foreign prejudice and exaggeration
were largely melodrama, the court poets themselves hint
at actual ruthlessness in contrast to their idealized Carolingian
chivalry. Boiardo made the romantic literary escape
frankly; and even Ariosto felt its spell. So Sir
Thomas Malory, who needed no lessons in violence from
Italy, escapes from the bitter Wars of the Roses to
Camelot. So a French professional soldier is idealized as
the Chevalier Bayard. With feudal service already obsolete
in the fourteenth century, chivalry had become altogether
what it had always been in part, poetry. There, indeed,
was a breach with the Middle Age; and it is earliest and
clearest in Italy. The ducal court is distinct both from
the idealized castle of the medieval romances and from
the actual castle of the Middle Age.</p>

<p>Patrons of painters and architects, the ducal courts
had also their orators and their poets. The orators had
the more distinct function of furnishing on occasion
ceremonious letters and addresses; they might be secretaries
and sometimes librarians. The poets devised the
characteristic Renaissance pageants for the solemn entries
of distinguished visitors or triumphing dukes. Both were
spokesmen in obituary, in nuptial greeting, in other encomium.
The pervasive encomium of the Renaissance may
have been directly stimulated by the ducal courts. How
important they were as literary centers is more difficult to
determine. Having a poet or an orator on the premises
has not always constituted a literary center. In some
cases the courts may have fostered literature less than they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
added it to their own adornment; in some cases a court
poet might feel himself rather thwarted than stimulated.
At least they were important enough to become literary
fictions. The setting of one of the most characteristic and
influential dialogues of the Renaissance, Castiglione’s
<i>Cortegiano</i> (1528) is the court of Urbino. Idealized of
course, this fixed the type of gracious culture which offsets
Macchiavelli’s realism and the Elizabethan melodrama of
lust and murder. The very name of the book has literary
significance. No single word is more characteristic of
Renaissance literature than <i>courtier</i>. In its wider sense it
describes not only Ariosto and Tasso, but also Ronsard
and Spenser.</p>

<p>The more permanent literary center of the period of
rapid commercial expansion was first Florence, where the
new commercial aristocracy lived cheek by jowl with the
bourgeoisie; then Lyon, commercial for a thousand years,
literary outpost of Italy in France. These are cardinal
examples of the intellectual interests and achievements
stirred in Venice, Bruges, London, and the other commercial
cities, by trade and printing. In Medicean Florence
social eminence demanded not only some interest in
the arts, but some acquaintance with them. Nicolao
Nicoli, merchant and scholar, was connoisseur enough to
see at a glance that the chalcedony on a boy’s neck was
a “Policreto.” The ideal of educated taste and skill set
up by Castiglione for Urbino is no less clear among the
merchant princes and their courtiers in Florence. The
great Cosimo dei Medici commissions Vespasiano to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
him a library worthy of his position, though he is daringly
reminded that libraries should not be made to order.
In Venice Minturno addresses the preface of his <i>De
poeta</i> to Gabriel Vinea, “pride of commerce, delight of
scholars” (<i>mercatorum decus ac deliciae literatorum</i>).
Lyon had wealthy leisure for the same reason as Venice.
Among the greater publishers of the sixteenth century
were its Gryphius, Rouville, and De Tournes. Its large
Italian population had been swelled by the exile ensuing
upon the Pazzi conspiracy. It published the romances of
Alamanni. Its most original author, Louise Labé, wrote
some of her sonnets in Italian. Maurice Scève was the
more typically a poet of his time in composing elaborate
pageants for its solemn entries. His uncle Guillaume’s
house was meantime a resort of scholars; and there is
abundant other evidence of lively and various literary
interchange. The literary leadership of Italy, then, was
maintained less by the ducal courts than by the commercial
cities. There it had animated the genius of Boccaccio and
of Chaucer. The later influence of Italy on Wiat, Surrey,
and Spenser, its more diffused influence through France,
seem less fruitful for the progress of literature than the
end of the Italian Middle Age.</p>

<p>Tardy recognition of this Italian continuity has led
some historians to include in the Renaissance not only
Chaucer, but Petrarch and Boccaccio, and even to begin it
with Dante. But this, though it rebukes the complacency
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, tends to obscure
the generally received significance of both Middle Age<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
and Renaissance. The terms are not outworn. The division
that they still express, after much revision of dates,
is of general literary habits. It is the change from the
feudal society living by manuscripts and reading aloud,
with Latin for an international language of communication
existing beside the established vernacular, to the
rapidly commercializing society living by printed books
amid widening education and nationalist aspirations, with
Latin specialized as the vernacular widens its circle of
readers. The latter is the society of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>The distinctive literary changes, indeed, were hardly
attained before the sixteenth century. Though humanism
as a theory was established in the fifteenth, the literary
product of that century was generally feeble, as of a
Middle Age gone to seed. Even the sixteenth century,
conscious of revival, eager for standards, proud of learning,
preoccupied with classicism, is more significant in its
theorizing than in its achievement, in criticism and study
than in literary advance. Whereas medieval poetry ranged
far beyond medieval poetic, first in Dante and last in
Chaucer, Renaissance poetry shows less advance in composition.
It has no Dante, no Chaucer. The <i>novella</i> does
not seize and carry forward the more intense narrative
found in his various experiments by Boccaccio. The
<i>Heptameron</i> of Marguerite de Navarre is narratively inferior
to the <i>Decameron</i>. The chivalric romances show a
departure rather in style than in method from medieval
romance; and their literary history from Ariosto to
Spenser is not in terms of narrative art. Spenser is but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the more typical of the Renaissance in that his great
achievement of verse and style suffices without onward
movement. The narrative slowness of his pageantry, the
descriptive dilation, descend through the Renaissance
partly from revived Alexandrianism, partly from medieval
patterns discarded by Chaucer. Renaissance poets are not
often even concerned with such a problem of composition
as Chaucer’s reconceiving and recomposing of a long old
story, lately retold with new life by Boccaccio, in his verse
novel <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>.</p>

<p>For all its confidence in a new day, Renaissance literary
theory repeats some medieval commonplaces. The <i>arts
poétiques</i> of the sixteenth century prolong the vogue of
the “Ars poetica” of Horace. The old doctrine of poetic
inspiration is renamed Platonic. The slighting of composition
by medieval manuals is continued. Renaissance
manuals are no less generally limited to style; for the old
preoccupation is confirmed by the new insistence on style
as an accomplishment and as conformity to standard.
Thus the Renaissance long accepted tacitly the medieval
confusion of poetic with rhetoric. Cicero’s <i>De oratore</i>
was found to have lessons for poetry; Bembo, even as
Johannes de Gerlandia, transferred from oratory to poetry
the conventional classification of the “three styles”; and
Minturno’s <i>De poeta</i> is by itself a complete identification
of poetic with rhetoric. But Renaissance theory gradually
advanced. The successive reinterpretations of Aristotle’s
<i>Poetic</i> finally opened the way for seventeenth-century
French classical drama. The better Renaissance rhetorics,
using Quintilian as well as the greater Cicero to guide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the increasing range and control of sixteenth-century
prose, set forth a sounder and more fruitful classicism.
Wherein classicism is typically a hindrance to literary
progress, and wherein it is stimulus and guide, is amply
revealed by the literary experience of the Renaissance.</p>

<span class="smaller">LATIN, GREEK, AND THE VERNACULARS</span></h2>

</div>

<h3 id="Chapter_II_1">1. HUMANISTIC LATIN</h3>

<p>The Middle Age had developed Latin style freely as
a medium of communication and variously as a
medium of expression. On these terms Latin had had a
progressive history as the literary language of western
Europe. Latin remained the literary language for Erasmus
and More in the early, for Buchanan even in the late, sixteenth
century. More habitually composed in Latin, even
when he meant to be printed in English; Erasmus and
Buchanan both composed and published in Latin exclusively.
The literary achievement of the vernaculars had
challenged the Latin primacy. But, thought the humanists,
that rivalry had been possible only because the
primacy had been misused. Latin primacy to them was an
article of literary faith, a dogma. It must not lapse; and
to restore its authority all they needed was to restore its
classical diction. No, says modern linguistic science in
retrospect, that was a delusion; it could only segregate
Latin farther. In fact Latin declined, slowly and as if
inevitably, from a primary language to a secondary. But
those who now mock the humanists for blindly hastening
the decline of Latin to a “dead” language should remember
that throughout the Renaissance itself Latin was active<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
in every country and with almost every man of letters. It
was far from dead; but it was no longer primary.</p>

<p>Evidently the scholars of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries saw in the Latin literature of their time the
revival of classical standards after medieval decadence.
Rejecting the medieval experience, they were bent on
restoring Latin to its classical eminence by reviving its
classical forms and style. They proposed a new Latin
literature in Augustan phrase.</p>

<p>Keeping its established place as the language of education,
Latin continued to be thought of as a norm of
permanence. As late as 1586 Montaigne, remembering
his boyhood, says (III. ii): “To me Latin is, as it were,
natural; I understand it better than French.” Later (1586-1588)
he adds (III. ix): “I am writing my book for a
few men and a few years. If there had been any idea of
its lasting, I must have committed it to a language of
more stability.” In other words, the vernaculars of course
would continue to shift; not Latin. For by Latin the
humanists meant the Latin of Vergil, Caesar, Sallust,
above all of Cicero, the Latin of the great period. Renaissance
humanism was a cult not merely of antiquity in
general, but specifically of Augustan Latin. It sought to
revive not only the ancient forms, but especially the
ancient diction. The literary preoccupation of the Renaissance
was with style. For the highest literary eminence,
said the humanists, writing must be in Latin, that is in the
superior language, and in Augustan Latin, that is in
the style of the superior period.</p>

<p>The humanists demanded conformity, then, to Augustan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
diction. Lorenzo Valla’s <i>Elegantiae linguae latinae</i>
(1476), reprinted again and again, first of a long line of
phrase books, and characteristic in its very title, was a
guide to conformity. Beyond conformity ranged imitation.
Humanistic Latin is imitative in theory, and in practice
so various as to furnish abundance of significant examples.
These various degrees and kinds will appear in subsequent
chapters. Meantime the obvious practical warrant for imitation
is in exercises. Imitation in any art is a recognized
means of study by practice; it is not an end. But Renaissance
enthusiasm for revival often made elegant conformity
a goal in itself. An oration might seem an
achievement by being Ciceronian, a pastoral dialogue by
being Vergilian. The subject, the idea, the message of a
speech, a letter, a poem might have little claim; nevertheless
publication might be warranted by the style. To
exhibit the elegant diction and the harmonious sentence-forms
of the great period might seem sufficient distinction.
“Thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.”
Posterity, instead of continuing to read such humanistic
imitations, has long forgotten them. Few literary products
have been less permanent than those of the cult of permanence.
A pervasive danger in this classicism was its
encouragement to a literature of themes.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_II_2">2. GREEK</h3>

<p>Even before the humanistic return to classical Latin
another vista of the ancient world had been opened by
the revival of Greek. Generally in abeyance through most
of the Middle Age, Greek had been recovered in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
fourteenth century and was well established in the early
fifteenth. It was studied by both Boccaccio and Petrarch.
It had its professor at the Florence <i>studium</i> (1396) in
Chrysolaras, who went to England in 1400. Guarino, his
pupil at Constantinople, after bringing Greek to Florence
and Venice, settled (1431) at Ferrara, and attracted
among his many famous pupils the Englishmen Gray,
Free, Gunthorpe, and Tiptoft.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Bessarion was at the
Council of Constance (1414). The fall of Constantinople
(1453), sending many Greek exiles to Italy, merely increased
opportunities already widely available. Even before
the establishment of printing there was increasing
circulation of manuscripts. Aurispa (1372-1460), for
instance, besides being scholar and professor, was an
active dealer. Printing came in the nick of time to spread
the new vogue. There was a Florence text of Homer in
1488, an Aldus in 1504. Aristotle, besides being translated
anew, had a Greek text in 1495 (Venice), another
in 1503 (Paris). Sophocles was printed by Aldus in
1502. Even the earliest sixteenth century commanded
texts of a considerable variety of Greek authors.</p>

<p>The variety, indeed, is striking. Evidently the humanistic
cult of an ideal period of Latin did not guide the
selection of Greek. All was fish that came to the Renaissance
Greek net. Late Greek was as welcome as the Greek
of the great dramatists and orators; Alexandrian, as epic.
With the vogue of Plato in the fifteenth century came
that of the neo-Platonists; with the texts and translations
of Aristotle, Hermes Trismegistus; with Homer, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
<i>Anthology</i> and Apollonius Rhodius. Isocrates vied once
more with Demosthenes. Nor did Sophocles oust Seneca,
or Thucydides prevail against Livy. The wide and continued
influence of sophistic appears in the vogue of
Athenaeus, Hermogenes, Aphthonius, and even Libanius.
Discrimination, indeed, was sometimes beyond Renaissance
scholarship. Henri Étienne, one of the best Greek
scholars of the sixteenth century, published (1554) a
collection of Byzantine imitations which he supposed to
belong to the time of Anacreon. This was the Anacreon
that inspired Ronsard and was translated by Belleau.
Since textual criticism was hardly understood before the
seventeenth century, hardly formulated before the eighteenth,
Renaissance printed texts are generally inaccurate.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Nevertheless to have Greek authors, classical and decadent,
at first hand, to read the message in its own style,
even imperfectly, was a literary experience and had some
excitement of exploration.</p>

<p>Thus was opened more widely a literature recommended
alike by the praise and by the imitation of the
Augustan Romans. Habits of language and style outside
the Latin tradition, for the first time in centuries, were
made generally available. How far they availed, how far
Greek operated as language, especially on the widening
vernacular literatures, can better be gathered from the
progress of this history than measured here in advance.
At first view the influence seems extensive. Renaissance
scholars as a matter of course at least professed to know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Greek; and most authors at least professed to be scholars.
Poliziano was both; and his knowledge of Greek seems
to have been solid. In 1485 his <i>Oratio in expositione
Homeri</i> thus compliments his university audience on its
command of Greek.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">You are those Florentines in whose city all Greek learning,
long extinct in Greece itself, has so revived and flourished that
both your men expound Greek literature in public lectures and
the youths of your highest nobility, as never has happened in
Italy for a thousand years, speak Attic so purely, so easily and
smoothly, that Athens, instead of being sacked and seized by
barbarians, seems itself, of its own will wrenched away with
its own soil and, so to speak, with all its furniture, to have
immigrated to Florence and there entirely and intimately to
have founded itself anew (Gryphius edition, Lyon, 1537-1539,
III. 63-64).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The obvious exaggeration of an introductory public lecture
does not lead him to quote Homer in Greek. The
abundant examples are given in his Latin translation.
Moreover this encomium of Homer relies not on specific
considerations of Greek language and style, but on such
conventional topics as could be derived equally well from
a translation. The writing of Greek, in spite of occasional
published efforts, is probably measured with his usual
justice by Bembo. “We study Greek not to use it, except
for exercise, but the better to explore Latin.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Poliziano,
in spite of his Greek and of his youthful achievement in
Italian verse, wrote the bulk of his work in Latin prose.
Rabelais from his monastery at Fontenay-le-Comte
(1521) invoked the help of Budé toward procuring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Greek books; he translated a Greek author who had
already been translated; but how much Greek he achieved
is hard to determine. Of Julius Caesar Scaliger, whose
Greek was one of his warrants for vanity, Egger says:
“though he knows much Greek, he seems to know it ill.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
The same critic records of Henri Étienne: “From the age
of fifteen he knew and spoke Greek almost as his native
language, and better than Latin.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Ronsard’s imitation
of Greek verse is based on knowledge of the Greek
language. Montaigne, saturated in Plutarch, tells us that
he knows no Greek. His Plutarch is the translation of
Amyot; and from Amyot, not from the Greek text of
Longus, is derived the vogue of <i>Daphnis and Chloe</i>. Both
the extent and the character of Greek influence may more
safely be estimated thus from individual literary forms
and even from individual authors.</p>

<p>One general influence may be guessed from the
stimulus given by Greek to the Renaissance vogue of
mythology. Boccaccio had already, in his <i>Genealogia
deorum gentilium</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> ranged beyond Ovid; and in the sixteenth
century such manuals as Natale Conti’s (Natalis
Comes) <i>Mythologiae</i> (1580) were in active demand.
Mythology equipped the poetry not only of printed books,
but also of pageants and solemn entries. It was so widely
pervasive as to seem almost obligatory. But how much of
this vogue was due to Greek? Greek mythology had been
in ancient times largely taken over into Latin. The distinctively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Greek habit, that is the earlier mythological
habit, is to feel and treat the myth not merely as a conventional
allusion, but as a perennial story. For the
literary use of mythology is twofold. Either it is decorative,
one of the ornaments of style, or it is itself a form
of poetry. The latter, the perennial recreation of Prometheus
or Medea, was less conspicuous in Latin poetry
than in Greek. How far the revival of Greek brought it
back may here and there be divined. It never quite dies.
The widespread medieval story of Mélusine is essentially
identical with Medea, though it did not come through
Greek. On the other hand, Ariosto’s Angelica bound to
the rock directly suggests Andromeda, though the myth
reappears also in the popular ballad of <i>Kemp Owen</i>.
Such myth-making gives a clue to Boccaccio’s <i>Ameto</i>.
There is something of it in Poliziano’s <i>Orfeo</i>. It is carefully
imitated from Pindar by Ronsard. It somewhat
vaguely animates Spenser. But it is not common in the
Renaissance. For the Renaissance generally, regarding
mythology in the more usual way as a mine of stylistic
ornament, was merely more anxious to have it standardized,
to be sure that gods and goddesses wore the correct
classical costumes. Diana in the <i>Venatio</i> (1512) of
Adrian, Cardinal Corneto, is such a figure; and her attendant
nymphs are as much part of the decoration as the
chased bowls. Indeed, the Middle Age, frankly adapting
ancient cults to its own time, had been nearer to the
Greek habit. Chaucer had made the temple in his <i>Troilus
and Criseyde</i> a cathedral, and called the Palladion a relic.
While Renaissance painting was handling mythology in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
this free way, Renaissance literature often used it merely
as archaistic decoration.</p>

<p>Thus it appears in Francesco Colonna’s fantastic allegory
<i>Hypnerotomachia</i> (1467), and in its abundant
woodcuts. The main figures, though they have Greek
names, are allegorical in the fashion of the <i>Roman de la
Rose</i>. The guide Logistica, for instance, is Reason; the
other guide, Thelemia,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Desire or Will. The nymphs met
at every turn serve for erotic suggestion; the Greek inscriptions,
for decoration. Colonna’s diction is studiously
deformed by such Greek coinage as <i>lithoglypho</i>, <i>hypaethrio</i>,
<i>chariceumati</i>. The precious style thus becomes a
dilated pedantic jargon. In the whole preposterous book
there is nothing Greek below the surface.</p>

<p>How far did Greek influence Renaissance thought?
Aristotle had dominated the Middle Age in the Latin
translations of Boethius and in Latin versions of the
Arabs. The Renaissance retranslated him and published
the Greek text. It restored him to challenge him. Were
the Renaissance translations superior to those of Boethius,
who was scholar and philosopher as well as poet? Did the
Renaissance texts convey him more truly? Renaissance
texts are often questionable; and Aristotle’s <i>Poetic</i>, at
least, was understood very slowly. The Renaissance welcomed
Plato. Was it Plato? Why is Renaissance Platonism
peculiarly difficult to measure, or even to define? Such
questions are relevant here only to the revival of the
Greek language. How far did this revival guide philosophy?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
The question comes up incidentally in one of
Sperone Speroni’s earlier dialogues, <i>Dialogo delle lingue</i>
(about 1540); and the answer is so unusual as to be startling.
Philosophy has not been advanced by our study of
Latin and Greek; it has been deviated. This sharp turn,
in a dialogue discussing the superiority of Latin and
Greek to the vernaculars, comes as a reminiscence of the
teaching of Peretto.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Peretto (p. 121) used to say that the time spent on learning
Latin and Greek actually hinders learning and developing
philosophy. No language (p. 123) has in itself any peculiar
value. Aristotle, therefore, not only may be studied in Latin,
but might be studied in Italian. In fact (p. 126), language
studies may be illusory, as we see around us. “I grieve at the
wretched condition of these modern times, in which study is
spent not in being, but in seeming wise.... We think we
know something well enough when, without comprehending
its nature, we are able to give it the name given by Cicero,
Pliny, Lucretius, Vergil, or Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes,
Aeschines.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Hardly more than a parenthesis, this stands out as a
challenge both of the superiority of Greek as a language
and, more generally, of Renaissance confidence in language
studies as a means of education.</p>

<p>Such challenges are rare. Bembo, in Speroni’s dialogue,
will not admit any such heresy as the equality of languages;
nor, we may well assume, would Sperone himself
admit that language study was hindering philosophy. For
the Renaissance generally agreed that education should
normally proceed through the study of languages. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
this the “new learning” was no less persuaded than the
old. The newness consisted in revising the traditional
Latin and in adding other languages, especially Greek.
Louvain established (1518) the College of the Three
Languages (Latin, Greek, and Hebrew); and the same
name was at first commonly applied to the Collège de
France (1530). Though this royal foundation was effectually
new in other aspects that now may seem more important,
its idea and inception came in great part from the
movement for Greek in education. Nor did the movement
stop with the individual college. Nothing more vividly
exemplifies Renaissance preoccupation with language
studies than the addition of Greek to the university curriculum.
Thwarted, in a time of bitter controversy, by the
association of Greek with Protestantism, the cause was
won before the end of the century. The prescription promulgated
officially in 1600, and the educational theory
behind it, held substantially for three hundred years.
There, at least, is a permanent result of the Renaissance.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_II_3">3. THE VERNACULARS</h3>

<h4 id="Chapter_II_3a">(<i>a</i>) <i>Italian</i></h4>

<p>The humanist assertion of the literary superiority of
Latin did not pass unchallenged even in the fifteenth
century. Alberti (1404-1472), scholar and philosopher,
insisted that actual communication, the conveying of a
message, should be in the vernacular, and set an example
by writing many of his learned works in Italian. Though
humanists might disparage even so great a succession as
Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, and in the languid period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
some promising ambitions might be deviated into Latin,
by the sixteenth century the literary rights of the vernacular
were both recovered in practice and acknowledged
in theory. The shift of opinion is significantly recorded by
Bembo. Elegant Latinist, accomplished poet in the vernacular,
judicious critic, he posed in an Italian literary
dialogue (<i>Prose</i>, Venice, 1525), Giuliano de’ Medici,
Federigo Fregoso, and Hercole Strozza discussing the
capacity of Italian style:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Our vernacular, most explored and perfected at Florence,
is more intimate to us than Latin, as to the Romans Latin was
than Greek (i-iv). Yes, but as Greek was then superior, so
Latin is now. Answer (v): if that implied that the superior
should always be cultivated, nobody would ever have written
well in his own language. As Cicero sought to augment the
authority of his own Latin, so did Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio
for Italian. Greek (vi) we may dismiss, since it is not
a medium for us; we study it not to use it, but the better to explore
Latin. Provençal (vii-xi), though once an important
language of literature and very influential in our early poetry,
has been superseded by Italian.</p>

<p>But if we are to use the vernacular for literature, <i>which</i> vernacular?
(xii) Italian is not uniform. Shall we adopt the
language of the Papal Court? No; it has not writers enough to
constitute literary authority. Tuscan (xiii-xv) is best, as having
shown amplest capacity, and as actually holding the literary
leadership.</p>

<p>Shall we incline, then, to its older usage, or to current popular
speech? Answer (xvi-xvii): we are not limited to this
dilemma. We may cultivate a diction that remains acceptable.
Cicero or Demosthenes made himself entirely intelligible to
the populace without speaking as the populace would have
spoken to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>II. An historical review (xx) of Italian poetry to and from
Dante finds all its graces united in Petrarch. So (xxi) all previous
prose writers were surpassed by Boccaccio. No subsequent
writers have equalled these two. Meantime Latin has been so
freed from the rust of ignorant centuries that today it has regained
its ancient splendor and charm.</p>

<p>In an analysis (xxiii-xxviii) of style under the classical
headings, Dante (xxiv) is rebuked for base words. He might
better have left out the things.</p>

<p>The qualities of vowels and of consonants (xxvii-xxviii),
and the three kinds of rhyme (xxix), with examples from
Petrarch, lead to a discussion of rhythm (<i>numero</i>, xxxii-xxxiii),
quantity (<i>tempo</i>, xxxv), and variation. The conclusion
reaffirms the preëminence of Petrarch and Boccaccio.</p>

<p>III. The noble works of Michael Angelo and of Raphael
should spur us to a like achievement in literature. This final
section discusses Tuscan in detail: word-forms, inflection,
syntax, and especially usage.</p>

</div>

<p>The dialogue opens a vista into contemporary thought
about style. The objection to Dante’s base words, startling
to us now, was made frequently then. No less characteristic
of the time is the homage to Petrarch as great poet
and as master of style. Giraldi Cinthio expressed the
common view in a flowery simile.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">But the law is not so strict for romances as not to permit
more license in words than is customary for sonnets and
canzoni. Long and serious subjects, if the conception is not to
be warped, need such latitude, which must nevertheless be
limited. Petrarch shows this clearly in his <i>Trionfi</i>. I will not
cite Dante; for whether through the fault of his age, or because
of his own nature, he took so many liberties that his
liberty became a fault. Therefore I find quite judicious that
painter who, to show us in a fair scene the literary value of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
the one poet and the other, imagined both in a green and
flowery mead on the slopes of Helicon, and put into Dante’s
hand a scythe, which, with his gown tucked up to his knees,
he was wielding in circles, cutting every plant that the scythe
struck. Behind Dante he painted Petrarch, in senatorial robe,
stooping to select the noble plants and the well-bred flowers—all
this to show us the liberty of the one and the judgment
and observance of the other (<i>Discorsi</i>, Venice, 1554, pp.
133-134).</p>

</div>

<p>What Bembo calls Tuscan was at once a fact and an
ideal. It is the current name not only for the diction of
Tuscany, but for the literary diction increasingly practiced
by all writers in Italian. Castiglione feels himself bound
to defend certain Lombard words. Ariosto anxiously revises
to conform. Tasso has a dispute with the <i>Accademia
della Crusca</i>. The most distinct dialect was in Naples. To
conform to Tuscan was for Neopolitans most nearly like
acquiring another language. But even there, and much
more readily in other parts of Italy, Tuscan was accepted
and increasingly practiced as literary Italian. Used by
scholars who also wrote Latin, Italian naturally learned
from Cicero and Vergil more logical and rhythmical
sentence habits, more adroit shaping of verse. Thus the
best result of humanism, perhaps, was the one least sought
by the humanists, the refinement of the vernacular.</p>

<p>Lodovico Dolce’s <i>Observations on the Vernacular</i>
(Venice, 1550) is an Italian grammar addressed to educated
readers and using the classical headings. A section
(157-186) on punctuation shows both the new emphasis
demanded by printing and a shift of control from rhythm
toward logic. Nearly fifty pages are devoted to Italian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
verse forms. Though there are many examples from Boccaccio
and a few from other authors, the great exemplar
throughout is Petrarch. Petrarch, then, was a model for
Italian poetry, Boccaccio for prose. As humanist Latin
had its thesaurus, so the cult of native models should have
wherewith to guide both study and imitation. Francesco
Alunno’s <i>Observations on Petrarch</i> (1539) is a concordance
plus a text of the sonnets and canzoni. His concordance
of Boccaccio’s <i>Decameron</i> (1543) has the
significant title <i>The Riches of the Vernacular</i>. Finally
<i>The Frame of the World</i> (<i>Della fabrica del mondo</i>,
1546-1548) is entitled further “ten books containing the
words of Dante, Petrarch, Bembo, and other good authors,
by means of which writers may express with ease and
eloquence all man’s conceptions of any created thing
whatsoever.” The ten divisions are God, heaven, the
world, the elements, the soul, the body, man, quality,
quantity, and hell. On this grandiose scale the thesaurus
carried out for mature writers in the vernacular the idea
of contemporary schoolbooks for Latin themes. It was
indeed a <i>copia</i>.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_II_3b">(<i>b</i>) <i>French</i></h4>

<p>Italian theory of the vernacular being typical generally,
and being moreover quickly known in France, the progress
of French thought need not be detailed. Jean Lemaire
allegorized <i>La Concorde des deux langages</i> (about 1512)
to urge Frenchmen and Italians together from lower to
higher poetry. No less than Italy France saw its literary
future in the vernacular. But France had not so compelling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
a literary past. Its fourteenth century had no such
mighty succession as Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. Its
medieval greatness was more remote; its medieval survivals,
generally languid. So the more ardent of coming
French poets were ready to repudiate not only medieval
Latin for classical Latin, but also medieval French verse
for a new, classical French poetry. The promotion of this
is the movement called the Pléiade; and its manifesto is
Joachim du Bellay’s <i>Deffense et illustration de la langue
française</i> (1549).</p>

<p>The main idea is so to <i>enrich</i> French diction as to
establish an equality with Greek and Latin. This is the
meaning of <i>illustration</i> in the title. More than a century
later Dryden used the same Latin root for the same idea
when he said that medieval English poetry lacked <i>lustre</i>.
Greek or Latin, Du Bellay urges, has no such linguistic
superiority as to compel our using it as our own literary
medium. Cultivation of the classics as languages leads to
pedantry. Philosophy is not a language study. Those who
so pursue it seem more anxious to show learning than to
have it. For a literary career, indeed, one must know Latin
and preferably Greek also, but not as an end and not as a
medium of expression. Latin and Greek, then, have their
value in the writer’s education, not in his writing; but
Du Bellay does not draw this inference explicitly, and
seems not to see the further inference that the real enriching
is not of one’s language, but of oneself. For he
proposes that French be improved by classical grafts, and
further by imitation of classical style. Let us enhance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
French literature, he urges, by making French language
more classical.</p>

<p>Thus to reduce the treatise to its lowest terms is quite
unjust to its suggestiveness. But its intrinsic value at best
is less than its historical. Ignoring a French medieval
achievement already forgotten or misunderstood, it turns
humanist imitation toward giving French poetry classical
lustre.</p>

<p>Such manipulation was unchecked by any considerable
knowledge of the actual development of language. Even
the learned Benedictine, Périon, derived French from
Greek (<i>Ioachimi Perionii Benedictini ... dialogorum de
linguae gallicae origine, eiusque cum graeca cognatione,
libri quatuor</i>, Paris, 1555; dedication dated 1554).</p>

<p>Périon is cautious in his conclusions, as in his title. He
has unusual grasp of phonetic cognates: b, f, p, v (p. 54);
t, d, th (p. 107 verso); c, ch, g, k (p. 125). He admits,
of course, the large influence of Latin. But he seems to
think that Gallic derived directly from Greek, and added
its abundant Latin later. What he cites in his parallels is
not Celtic, but French. Though the historical introduction
is negligible, the linguistic proof, even where it is in
error, shows both awareness of language processes and
some scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>French is like Greek, he finds, in the habit of articles
(p. 107), in accent (p. 111), in nouns ending -on and
te, in having an aorist (p. 134), in using the infinitive as
a verbal noun (p. 135). Thus though his theory and many
of his particular derivations are unsound, his method of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
observing language habits is ahead of his time. Citing
Budé, Baif, and a few Latin authors, he seems in the
main to have worked independently from his own observations.</p>

<p>That so much knowledge of detail should reach so little
grasp of the whole shows the prevailing ignorance of
linguistic science.</p>

<p>The last quarter of the sixteenth century raised among
the vernaculars the question of rank. Enthusiasm for the
theory and the achievement of Italian had led some
Frenchmen, in spite of the triumphs of Ronsard, to disparage
their own. In 1579, thirty years after Du Bellay’s
manifesto, Henri Étienne (Henricus Stephanus), scholar
and editor, sought not only to vindicate French rights, but
to demonstrate French superiority, in his book on the
<i>Preëminence of the French Language</i> (<i>Project du livre
entitulé De la précellence du langage françois</i>).<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Under the headings weight (<i>gravité</i>, p. 196), charm
(<i>grace</i>, p. 217), and range (<i>richesse</i>, p. 246) he proposes
to prove (p. 176) that “our French language surpasses
all the other vernaculars.” Spanish he dismisses
(p. 179) as evidently inferior to Italian, and hence to
French. English is not even mentioned. The demonstration
is of French superiority to Italian.</p>

<p>First (p. 181), French is more stable. We have never
needed “grands personnages” to tell Frenchmen how to
use French. Where they have occasionally done so for
pleasure, they have not left us in the dark with their
disputes. The objection that we are not agreed as to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
part of France has standard French, nor as to how it
should be spelled, is rebutted. French and Italian translations
of the same original (p. 204) are put side by side.
It is noteworthy that Ronsard (pp. 207-208) in each
case dilates.</p>

<p>In detail, Italian inflectional endings lead to monotony
(p. 218); and Italian word-forms are not consistently
adapted from the Latin. French is richer in diminutives
(p. 241), in its legacy (p. 260) from medieval romances
and crafts, and (p. 314) in proverbs. Its facility in adaptation
(p. 280) appears especially in compounds.</p>

<p>An Italian of equal learning could readily counter on
each of these points. Could he disprove the whole? Could
he prove the superiority of Italian? Can any language be
proved superior to all others? As between two modern
languages, the preference, many would say, is grounded
not on demonstration, but on taste and habit. Italian
cannot be proved superior or inferior to Spanish, French
to English. Each writer naturally prizes the language that
he knows best above another that he knows less. Étienne’s
thesis is not susceptible of proof. Perhaps; but what of
Greek and Latin? Some men even today, far more in the
Renaissance, would offer to prove that Greek is a superior
language. For Étienne’s treatise raises in a new quarter an
old question that even now is not answered unanimously.</p>

<p>Whatever one’s attitude toward this larger question,
and however unconvincing Étienne may seem, his treatise
is not absurd; nor is it a Renaissance <i>tour de force</i>. It is
both serious and learned. Latinist and Hellenist, exact in
the fine tradition of his house, he had the right to speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
on language. His citing (p. 288) of historical consonant
change shows some inkling, most uncommon in his time,
of linguistic science. But in 1579 he could not know
linguistic sufficiently. He assumes, as Du Bellay does, that
processes of language are largely conscious, even deliberate
choice (pp. 224, 400). His assumption that Provençal
is French (Bembo had assumed that it was Italian)
is not mere begging of the question. No one of his time
could know the historical processes by which Provençal,
Tuscan, Spanish, northern French, not to mention other
tongues, had evolved from Latin. Even so, some of his
citations of forms still have linguistic value. The larger
value is in the literary discrimination of his wide reading,
in the ingenious device of parallel translations, and in the
significance of a dispute that was bound to recur as each
vernacular came to represent more and more a national
self-consciousness.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_II_3c">(<i>c</i>) <i>English</i></h4>

<p>National self-consciousness became notorious in England
with the Elizabethans. Even with them lingers a
certain nervousness as to the capacity of the English
language. Such doubts arose not only from humanistic
exaltation of Latin, but even more from ignorance of linguistic
history. The barren fifteenth century had at least
established the language of London as the English literary
norm. The northern speech indiscriminately called Scotch,
though its literary use persisted through the sixteenth
century, came to be regarded as a dialect. The language of
Malory’s <i>Morte d’Arthur</i>, and generally of Caxton’s publications,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
is substantially the same as that of the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>. By the time of Surrey, England had its
Tuscan. Sixteenth-century literary usage in England,
though its emergence from the barren period may seem
slower than in Italy and France, is hardly more lax. The
recklessness of Skelton, as the later recklessness of
Rabelais, was individual extravagance. The vagaries of
Spenser are not reckless; they are deliberate archaism.
Where they violate the language of Chaucer, they show
merely that a Renaissance poet who knew Latin and
Greek, as well as French and Italian, might remain unaware
of linguistic history, even in his own language. If
the printed texts that he used had been more accurate, he
might still have been too bent on following the lead of the
Pléiade in manipulating language toward a new poetry to
notice the difference between an infinitive and a preterit.
For him Chaucer’s words were color and sound, not
forms. But though he misread Middle English, he felt too
deeply what Ascham missed altogether, the tradition of
English poetry, to dally long with classicizing metric.
There had been no one to do for Chaucer what Alunno
had done for Petrarch. Nevertheless, even without the
help of good lexicons and grammars, Renaissance English
shows a sufficient continuity of literary acceptance.</p>

<p>Prose, of course, lingered behind verse. Chaucer’s prose
rendering of Boethius, in sharpest contrast to his verse,
had been groping. Malory’s prose was sufficient for narrative,
though not for such philosophical discussion. Prose
control in both narrative and discussion seems assured
first in Sir Thomas More; but as late as John Lyly the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
progress of prose was still uncertain. The brief vogue of
“Euphuism” shows an attempt to “enrich” the vernacular
by Latin sentence figures. Lyly came to recognize that the
vernacular had its own literary ways and its own literary
rights. Finally from being a court writer he turned to
whole-hearted pursuit of the actual vernacular in order to
win the larger audience. For the idea of changing one’s
native language by classical grafts or other literary manipulation,
though it was unchecked by any accurate or
extensive linguistic science,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> gradually gave way before
the facts of literary experience.</p>

<span class="smaller">IMITATION OF PROSE FORMS, CICERONIANISM, RHETORICS</span></h2>

</div>

<h3 id="Chapter_III_1">1. ORATIONS, LETTERS, DIALOGUES</h3>

<p>Renaissance classicism is most obvious in adoption
of prose forms. Orations, letters, dialogues, first
in Latin, then in the vernaculars, studiously conform. Orations
were none the less a preoccupation because they had
little to do with affairs. Actual Renaissance conduct of
government soon left little room for moving the people
to action by oratory. Legal pleading, as always, had its
special technic. But the oratory of occasion, that third
type which marks anniversaries, extols achievements, and
commemorates great men, was invited widely and cultivated
classically. It embraces most of the published
oratory of the Renaissance, and was practiced by most of
the humanists in Latin. Leonardo Bruni of Arezzo
(Leonardo Aretino) is typical both as official orator of
Florence and in his early imaginary orations. Agostino
Dati of Siena delivered an encomium of Eusebius (<i>De
laudibus D. Eusebii presbyt. Stridonensis et Ecclesiae
maximi doctoris, in ejus solemniis publice habita, anno
1446</i>). The funeral of Cardinal Bessarion at Rome had
a Latin oration by the Cardinal Capranica. Jacopo Caviceo
cast his congratulatory address to Maximilian on the
victory (1490) over King Ladislaus of Bohemia in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
form called <i>prosopopoeia</i>, that is, of imaginary addresses
by Babylon, Troy, Byzantium, Carthage, and Rome
(<i>Urbium dicta ad Maximilianum Federici Tertii Caesaris
filium Romanorum regem triumphantissimum</i>, Parma,
1491). The Cologne collection, <i>Orationes clarorum virorum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
made such oratory available for study and imitation.</p>

<p>Of the Italian orations collected by Francesco Sansovino
(Venice, 1561, including some translations) as representative
of his time, only one fifth are political, and
these only to the extent of being hortatory. The rest are
all occasional: nine funeral orations, a Christmas address,
two before an academy, a call to high aim, a praise of
Italian, four congratulations, and four imaginary addresses
(<i>prosopopoeiae</i>). Claudio Tolomei has two imaginary
orations, one for, the other against.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Such oratory, of
course, is perennial. Its Renaissance vogue is distinctive
only in being almost exclusive and in being imitative.
Bartolomeo Ricci records<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that on two occasions in his
office of public orator at Ferrara he imitated specific orations
of Cicero. The habit was general. The desire to
sound classical led even to the lifting of Augustan phrases
and cadences. Similar conditions had led the decadent
Greek oratory called sophistic<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> into archaism as a means
of display. Renaissance oratory, even when it was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
led further into the sophistic sacrifice of the message to
the speaker, was thus habitually literary. In Latin especially
it was less often a means of persuasion than an
imitative literary form.</p>

<p>What the Latin oration might nevertheless attain was
exhibited by the lectures of Poliziano and again in the
range of Marc Antoine Muret (Muretus, 1525-1585).
From a conventional <i>praelectio</i> on the <i>Aeneid</i> (1579)
Muret turned to Tacitus (1580), not only with lively
vigor, but with penetrative suggestion and urgent sentences.
When he returned to official oratory for the feasts
of St John Evangelist (1582) and the Circumcision
(1584), he kept the suggestiveness within the obligatory
pattern. True to their kind, models of conciseness, these
have also their own appeal. Occasional oratory in the
Renaissance, then, might be a literary achievement and a
literary progress. More generally it was but one evidence
of the Renaissance preoccupation with rhetoric.</p>

<p>No less inevitable among the published works of the
humanists are their collected Latin letters. Since these
had been carefully composed and revised, they might
serve not only history, but literature. Sometimes in effect
essays, sometimes almost orations, they are sometimes
themes. The favorite model is Cicero; and in extreme
cases the letter seems to consist of style. It is hardly a
letter; it is an exercise. But thus to label Renaissance
letter-writing generally would be grossly unfair. Poliziano’s
letter to Paolo Cortesi is admirable as a letter, and
comes into literary history on that ground. For so letters
have entered literature in any time. A Latin letter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
John of Salisbury<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> lifts the heart and fills the eyes. Its
cadences are studiously conformed to the <i>cursus</i> of the
Curial <i>dictamen</i>; its diction is expertly chosen to strike
always by appeal and suggestion, never by violence; its
hazardous course steers between Scylla and Charybdis because
it is constantly shaped to its goal. For all this skill
is spent singly on making the truth prevail. A less important,
but more famous English letter, Dr Johnson’s to the
Earl of Chesterfield, is no less studious of style, no less
expertly adjusted, even to the phrasing of the obligatory
subscription, and no less single in its aim. Those who
make light of such delicacy as mere style have much to
learn both of letters and of literature. Among the works of
Erasmus none is more important than his collected letters.
The Renaissance did well to study Latin letters, and
learned much. But it was mistaken in thinking that a
letter reaches posterity except by reaching its original
address and aim. The Latin letters of the Renaissance
often betray a tendency to regard classical style as an end
in itself. Such letters, written to be literary, give the impression
that the Latin letter is a Renaissance literary
form.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most popular of ancient prose forms in
the Renaissance was the dialogue; for it was used even
oftener in the vernaculars than in Latin, and became a
favorite form of exposition. The Middle Age, of course,
had many dialogues, but not of this sort. <i>Débat</i>, <i>estrif</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
<i>conflictus</i>, amoebean eclogue were often allegorical and
generally forms of poetry. Renaissance dialogue is typically
prose discussion. Its vogue was evidently stimulated
by the increasing availability of Plato in both translation
and Greek text; but its method is not often his. The
Platonic dialogue typically conveys the illusion of creative
conversation. As Sperone Speroni observes,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> it is a sort
of prose that takes after poetry. It invites the reader to
join a quest for truth, to feel his way with the speakers,
to measure this objection, respond to that hint; and often
it leaves him still guessing with them, still questing. The
other ancient literary type of dialogue is Cicero’s <i>De
oratore</i>. This is less conversation than debate with definite
argument, rebuttal, and progress to a conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Cicero’s
dialogue is not a quest; it is an exposition of something
already determined, and it unfolds that by logical stages.
Renaissance dialogue, having generally his object, turns
oftener to his type; but it does not forget Plato. The more
dramatic grouping of friends in converse appealed widely
to Renaissance imagination. It was imitated in Platonic
academies as well as in writing; and its form of dialogue
opened more opportunities for exhibiting one’s literary
acquaintance and bringing forward one’s literary friends.
Further Renaissance dialogues did not often go with
Plato. They stopped with the Platonic setting, or used
challenges merely for transition. Even the most popular of
them all, Castiglione’s <i>Cortegiano</i>, though its <i>personae</i> are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
unusually distinct, and though it concludes upon Platonic
love, is evidently framed upon the <i>De oratore</i>. Platonic
dialogue must be easy to read; it is by no means easy to
write; witness the failure of many imitations, both Renaissance
and modern. It is a very delicate adjustment of
poetic to rhetoric. The grafting of Plato on Cicero demands
long preparation. The usual Renaissance compromise
of letting Plato introduce the speakers and Cicero
rule their discourse was practically sufficient for the better
Renaissance dialogues. The inferior ones have nothing
but the externals of either. Their rejoinders, neither conversation
nor debate, become tedious ceremony;<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and their
composition lacks the Ciceronian sequence. But even these
show how widely the dialogue form was imitated from
antiquity.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_III_2">2. CICERONIANISM</h3>

<p>The pervasive humanistic imitation was not adoption
of forms; it was borrowing of style. The logical extreme
of the humanist cult of Augustan Latin is the exclusive
imitation of Cicero as the ideal of prose style. In 1422
Gherardo Landriani, Bishop of Lodi, drew from a long-forgotten
chest in the cathedral library a complete manuscript
of the principal works of Cicero on rhetoric. The
<i>De oratore</i> and the <i>Orator</i> are the most mature and suggestive
treatment of oratory by the greatest Roman orator.
“<i>Summe gaudeo</i>, I have the greatest delight,” wrote
Poggio on receiving the news in London; and Niccolo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
de’Niccoli of Florence promised a copy to Aurispa in
Constantinople. So widely was the world of scholarship
stirred. For the recovery of the greater Cicero directly
stimulated Renaissance classicism. In the Middle Age
Cicero had been rather a name of honor than a literary
influence. His <i>De inventione</i>, a common source of medieval
rhetoric, is only a youthful compend. What was usually
added for further study, especially of style, the
<i>Rhetorica ad Herennium</i>, was ascribed to him quite erroneously.
His greater works on rhetoric were appreciated
doubtless here and there, as by John of Salisbury, but
not generally. Hence the recovery of the <i>De oratore</i> in
1422 was indeed an event in the history of literature.
This and <i>Orator</i> are fine encomia of the higher function
of oratory, and of the orator as leader. Neither is a
manual. Both in Cicero’s intention are contributions to the
philosophy of rhetoric. Without very original or even very
specific doctrine they are eloquently persuasive. What did
the Renaissance do with them?</p>

<p>Most obviously it carried classicism to the extreme of
Ciceronianism, that exclusive imitation which made Cicero
the ideal of Latin prose, the perfect model. The doctrine
involves certain characteristic assumptions: (1) that Latin,
or any other language, attains in a certain historical period
its ideal achievement and capacity, (2) that within such
a great period style is constant, (3) that a language can
be recalled from later usage to earlier in scholastic exercises,
(4) that such exercises can suffice for personal
expression, (5) that a single author can suffice as a model,
even for exercises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>Medieval Latin had departed from classical usage because
it was a living language, so widely active in communication
as to grow. Men used it without being
disconcerted by changes from place to place, from time
to time. Such changes are inevitable so long as a language
is used generally. Denotations are extended or contracted,
connotations are modified or superseded, even by written
use. Oral use adds changes in cadence. From the seventh
century on through the Middle Age Latin was accentual.
The speech tune of Cicero had faded; and no one had tried
to resuscitate what had been supplanted by other cadences.
The Latin hymns had carried medieval measures to the
heights of poetry. Not till the seventeenth century did
humanism succeed in having them revised classically; and
fifty volumes have since been spent in recovering their
medieval forms.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The extreme form of Renaissance
classicism, by ignoring the historical development of
language, tended to inhibit the use of Latin in immediate
appeal.</p>

<p>So rigid a doctrine did not, of course, enlist all Renaissance
humanists. The more judicious were content to
select certain expert habits, especially Cicero’s strong and
supple wielding of sentences. But the extremists, such as
Christophe de Longueil (Longolius, 1488-1522), got
fame; the doctrine continued in teaching and in practice;
and as late as 1583 there was point in Sidney’s scornful
allusion to “Nizolian paper books.” His readers knew
that he meant the use of the Cicero thesaurus as a handbook
for composition. Even where it did not enlist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
devotees, Ciceronianism confirmed the prevalent idea of
the standard diction of the great period. Yet before the
end of the fifteenth century both the general assumption
and the particular cult had been exploded by Poliziano.
As university teacher, in the introductory lecture (<i>praelectio</i>)
of his course at Florence on Quintilian and Statius,
he challenged the doctrine of the ideal classical period by
a plea for the pedagogical value of later Latin.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Finally I would not attach undue importance to the objection
that the eloquence of these writers was already corrupted by
their period; for if we regard it aright, we shall perceive that
it was not so much corrupted and debased as changed in kind.
Nor should we call it inferior just because it is different. Certainly
it shows greater cultivation of charm: more frequent
pleasantry, many epigrams, many figures, no dull realizations,
no inert structure; all not so much sound as also strong, gay,
prompt, full of blood and color. Therefore, though we may
indisputably concede most to those authors who are greatest,
so we may justly contend that some qualities which are earlier
attained and much more attainable [i.e., by students] are
found in these [minor authors]. So, since it is a capital vice
to wish to imitate one author and him alone, we are not off
the track if we study these before those, if we do some things
for their practical use.... [So, he adds, did Cicero himself
when he turned from the Attic orators to the Rhodian and
even to the Asiatic.] So that noble painter who was asked
with what master he had made the most progress replied
strikingly “With that one,” pointing to the populace; yes,
and rightly too. For since nothing in human nature is happy
in every aspect, many men’s excellences must be viewed, that
one thing may stick from one, another thing from another,
and that each [student] may adapt what suits him (<i>Opera</i>,
Gryphius edition, Lyon, 1537-1539, III, 108-109).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps nothing else so pointed and telling against
Ciceronianism was written during the Renaissance as
Poliziano’s letter to Paolo Cortesi.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Nor are those who are thought to have held the first rank of
eloquence like one another, as has been remarked by Seneca.
Quintilian laughs at those who shall think themselves cousins
of Cicero because they conclude a period with <i>esse videatur</i>.
Horace declaims against imitators who are nothing but imitators.
Certainly they who compose only by imitation seem
to me like parrots or magpies uttering what they do not understand.
For what they write lacks force and life, lacks impulse,
lacks emotion, lacks individuality, lies down, sleeps, snores.
Nothing true there, nothing solid, nothing effective. But are
you not, some one asks, expressing Cicero? What of it? I
am not Cicero. I am expressing, I think, myself. Besides, there
are some, my dear Paul, who beg their style, as it were bread,
piecemeal, who live not only from the day, but unto the day.
Thus unless they have at hand the one book to cull from, they
cannot join three words without spoiling them by rude connection
or disgraceful barbarism. Their speech is always
tremulous, vacillating, ailing, in a word so ill cared and ill
fed that I cannot bear them, especially when they pass judgment
on those whose styles deep study, manifold reading, and
long practice have as it were fermented. But to come back to
you, Paul, of whom I am very fond, to whom I owe much,
whose talent I value very highly, I am asking whether you
so bind yourself by this superstition that nothing pleases you
which is simply yours, and that you never take your eyes from
Cicero. When you have read Cicero—and other good authors—much
and long, worn them down, learned them by heart,
concocted, filled your breast with the knowledge of many
things, and are now about to compose something yourself, then
at last I would have you swim, as the saying is, without corks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
take sometimes your own advice, doff that too morose and
anxious solicitude to make yourself merely a Cicero—in a
word risk your whole strength (<i>Opera</i>, Gryphius edition, Lyon,
1537-1539, I, 251).</p>

</div>

<p>The writer of that letter, in spite of his youthful
triumphs in the vernacular, gave his mature years to the
writing of Latin and the teaching of Latin and Greek
literature. Unfortunately his expert Latin did not move
Renaissance classicism to abandon either the practice of
Ciceronianism or the theory of the ideal great period.</p>

<p>Some forty years after the destructive analysis of
Poliziano, Ciceronianism was still active enough to draw
the satire of Erasmus in the <i>Dialogus Ciceronianus</i>
(1528). This <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, beginning with the
error of using a Cicero thesaurus as a handbook for composing,
proceeds to the affectation of using for the Christian
religion the terms proper to classical paganism:
Jupiter Optimus Maximus for God the Father, Apollo for
the Christ. Erasmus amuses himself by thus rewriting the
Apostles’ Creed in Ciceronian terms. His point is not
merely the pedantry of such paganism, nor its irreverence,
but its unreality. Only the words can be taken over; the
meaning or the suggestion, in one direction or the other,
is violated. The point had been made more forcibly,
because more practically, by Poliziano. Preoccupation with
past usage thwarts the expression of actual present things
and thoughts. Further Erasmus makes his Ciceronian
admit that the cult is illusory, a dream which according
to its own adepts has never quite come true. Incidentally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
the names thus brought up in the dialogue are not only
of those Ciceronians who had at least a transient fame,
but also of some whom history does not even know.</p>

<p>In spite of this destructive satire, Giulio Camillo reaffirmed
Ciceronianism with undisturbed simplicity.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Latin is no longer spoken, as our vernacular is, or French; it
has been shut up in books. Since we are limited to gathering
it not from actual speech, but from books, why not rather
from the perfect than from the inferior? Let us first recall
the language to the state in which we may believe it to have
been while Vergil wrote it, or Cicero, and then confidently
use that, even as Vergil did, or Cicero? (<i>Trattato della imitatione</i>,
1544.)</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In 1545 Bartolomeo Ricci, tutor to Hercole d’Este’s son
Lorenzo, closed his treatise <i>De imitatione</i> with a Ciceronian
credo and a long defense of Longolius. Ciceronianism,
then, survived both rebuttal and satire. As late as
1580 Muret, having renounced his own early Ciceronianism,
attacked its major premise, the doctrine of the ideal
great period. His argument is not, as Poliziano’s a
hundred years before, pedagogical; it is a direct challenge
to Renaissance competence in judging Latin style. His
previous <i>praelectio</i> had urged the distinctive claims of
Tacitus: practical philosophy, finished economy of style.
This second lecture on Tacitus deals with objections. The
preference for Suetonius he merely dismisses. But Tacitus
is accused of inaccuracy. By whom? By Vopiscus; and who
is Vopiscus? Tacitus is hostile to the Christian religion.
Shall we rule out all the pagans? The rest of the lecture
deals with style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There remain two objections brought against Tacitus by the
inexpert: that his style is obscure and rough, and that he does
not write good Latin. When I hear complaints of the obscurity
of Tacitus, I reflect how easily people transfer their own
faults to others. [I remember the anecdote of the man who
complained that the windows were too small, when the real
trouble was his own failing sight. So a deaf man was heard
to complain that people did not speak distinctly.]</p>

<p>But Tacitus, says another, is rough. Alciati, praising his
friend Jovius, has not feared to call the histories of Tacitus
thorny. Well, praising Jovius shows as much judgment as
blaming Tacitus. No two could be more different. Tacitus
could not but displease a man who made so much of Jovius....
For Jovius is all smooth; he has not a trace of that roughness
which offends Alciati in Tacitus. He not only flows; he overflows....
As Alciati is afraid of roughness, I am sick of silliness.
Sirup for babes; but let me have a bowl of something
with a tang.</p>

<p>Finally, those who grant to Tacitus his other qualities still
deplore his bad Latin. The first movers of this calumny, each
of whom had spent much pains in expounding Tacitus, were
Alciati and Ferret. If they themselves wrote Latin as well as
they think, perhaps we might be disturbed by their authority.
Do you make bold, some one may say, to judge such men?
They have made bold to judge Tacitus.... [If we can know
Latin (as Camillo says) only from books (and, we may add,
from comparatively few books), we have the less warrant for
judging Latin usage.]... Who dare affirm for certain today,
when “the old authors” are so extolled, that the questioned
phrases of Tacitus were never used by these “old authors?”
(Leipzig ed. of 1660, vol. II, pp. 108-112.)</p>

</div>

<p>Even now, perhaps, though the name of the heresy has
long been forgotten, the Ciceronian perversion of imitation
is not extinct. But if this kind of imitation is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
valid, what kinds are valid? Imitation of style may be
suggestive when it remains subconscious, not the recalling
of words, but the adaptation of remembered rhythms.
The deliberate conformity proposed by Ciceronianism
can be useful only as exercise, as the learning of certain
effects by trying them. Once learned, these become an
added resource in revision. In composing, in the creative
process of bringing one’s message to one’s audience,
deliberate imitation of style has no warrant. It would at
least interrupt, and might deviate or inhibit. In so far as
Ciceronianism confuses two processes normally separate,
composing and revising, it tends to make style stilted.</p>

<p>Further, Ciceronianism narrows imitation by a theory
of perfectionism. The <i>Imitatio Christi</i> (about 1460) is
the direct appeal of an author preoccupied with his message.
Sébastien Châteillon (1515-1563) rewrote its spontaneous
Latin in Ciceronian cadences. It was imperfect; he
would make it perfect. If this was pedantic, even absurd,
wherein? If the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> should not be rewritten
in the style of Hooker or of Sir Thomas Browne, why?
Because <i>the</i> one ideal style is an illusion.</p>

<p>Finally, imitation need not be of style; it may be of
composition; and for writing addressed to an actual
public this is at once more available and more promising.
For real writing, that is for a message intended to move
the public, imitation generally risks less, and gains more,
in guiding the plan, the whole scheme, the sequence.
Renaissance preoccupation with style and tolerance of
published themes tended to obscure the larger opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>But there is no Ciceronianism in Castiglione’s adopting
the form of Cicero’s <i>De oratore</i> for his <i>Cortegiano</i>.
Though he naturally shows awareness of Cicero’s expert
periods, he is bent not on conformity of style, but on
focusing the typical man of his own time in the literary
frame used by Cicero for the typical Augustan Roman.
Renaissance imitation of Vergil’s style was often futile;
but Tasso’s <i>Jerusalem</i> was animated and guided by
Vergil’s epic sequence. Robert Garnier, imitating the style
of Euripides, missed the dramatic composition; but Corneille
caught the whole scheme of a Greek tragedy. Such
larger imitation imposes no restraint on originality. Its
recognition of ancient achievement is in practical adaptation
to one’s own conception and object and time. In
this direction the classicism of the seventeenth century
became more fruitful than that of the sixteenth.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_III_3">3. RHETORICS</h3>

<p>Manuals and treatises on rhetoric published in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries exhibit marked differences
in tradition, scope, and tendency. They range from
narrow concentration on style to a full treatment of the
five parts of rhetoric. They exhibit sophistic as well as
rhetoric. Some persist in medieval preconception as others
recover the classical heritage of Aristotle and Quintilian.
The works mentioned below are typical of the many
Renaissance manuals.</p>

<p>The <i>Rhetorica</i> (1437?) of George of Trebizond shows
in brief the whole classical scope:<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> <i>inventio</i>, the exploration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of the subject and the determination of its <i>status</i>;
<i>dispositio</i>, plan and order; <i>elocutio</i>, style; <i>memoria</i>, the
art of holding a point for effective placing; and <i>pronuntiatio</i>,
delivery. He is most expansive on the first, which
had been both neglected and misapplied by the Middle
Age.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The presentation of rhetoric by Juan Luis Vives (<i>De
ratione dicendi</i>, Bruges, 1532; reprinted in Vol. II of the
Majansius edition of his works) is both meager and
vaguely general.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Vives urges that rhetoric is not a study for boys, and that it
should not be confined to diction. But he himself offers hardly
anything specific about composition. Book I deals mainly with
sentences (<i>compositio</i>), e.g., with dilation and conciseness as
in the <i>Copia</i> of Erasmus, and with the period. Book II offers
brief generalizations on type or tone of style, on the conventionalized
measure of native ability against study and revision,
on consideration of emotions and moral habits, on the threefold
task of instructing, winning, and moving, and on appropriateness.
Book III deals with narration (history, exempla,
fables, poetry), paraphrase, epitome, commentary. History as
composition is hardly even considered.</p>

</div>

<p>His incidental discussion of rhetoric in <i>De causis corruptarum
artium</i> and <i>De tradendis disciplinis</i> (Vol. VI
of the collective edition) is no more satisfying. In Book
IV of the former Vives so far misconceives the classical
<i>inventio</i> as to rule it out of rhetoric altogether. Thus he
practically ratifies the procedure of those Renaissance
logicians who classified <i>inventio</i> and <i>dispositio</i> under
logic. The classification was not a reform; it merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
recorded tardily the medieval practice of reducing rhetoric
to style by relying for all the active work of composition
on debate. Yet Vives pays repeated homage to both
Aristotle and Quintilian.</p>

<p>On the other hand the concise manual of Joannes
Caesarius (<i>Rhetorica</i>, Paris, 1542) returns to the full
classical scope. The source cited most explicitly and
quoted most frequently is Quintilian.</p>

<p>But that later ancient tradition called sophistic, which
had deviated the rhetoric of the Middle Age, had also its
Renaissance revival. Giulio Camillo (1479-1550), known
in France as well as in Italy, published together a treatise
on the orator’s material, the oratorical fund, and another
on imitation (<i>Due trattati ... l’uno delle materie che
possono venir sotto lo stile dell’eloquente, l’altro della
imitatione</i>, Venice, 1544-1545). His constant preoccupation
is with the topics, headings, commonplaces (<i>loci</i>)
which guide the writer’s preparation. Such are the headings
of the sophistic recipe for encomium: birth and
family, native city, deeds, etc. But sophistic had elaborated
such obvious suggestions for exploring one’s material into
a system applicable both to material and to style. Camillo’s
source is:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">the <i>Ideas</i> of Hermogenes, who in each considers eight things:
the sense, the method, the words, the verbal figures, the
clauses, their combination, sentence-control (<i>fermezza</i>), and
rhythm. But my method is perhaps easier, since I proceed not
from the forms (<i>forme</i>) to the materials, but from the materials
to the forms.... I have sought how many things can
combine to produce the forms, and I find (as I have argued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
in my Latin orations) not eight things, as Hermogenes writes,
but fourteen which may enter to modify any material. They
are these: conceptions, or inventions (<i>Trovati</i>), passions, commonplaces,
ways of speaking (<i>le vie del dire</i>), arguments,
order, words, verbal figures, clauses, connectives, sentence
forms, cadence (<i>gli estremi</i>), rhythms, harmonies.</p>

</div>

<p>This bewildering cross-division might serve as the
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the system of bringing on eloquence
by topics if Camillo had not gone even further in
a grandiose symbolistic scheme entitled <i>L’idea del theatro</i>
(Florence, 1550). The theater here is not any actual
stage; it is the manifold pageant of the world presented
allegorically by topics for all literary purposes.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Starting from the medieval, or perhaps the neo-Platonic, premise
that sacred things are not revealed, but figured, he divides
his book into seven <i>gradi</i>. Seven is the perfect number; e.g.,
seven planets, Isaiah’s seven columns, Vergil’s <i>terque quaterque</i>,
etc. Each <i>grado</i> is named after a planet, whose attributes
are a mixture of astrology and mythology, as in the Middle
Age, but again with a suggestion of orientalized Platonism.
This general scheme constitutes the first section. The second
is entitled <i>Il convivio</i>; the third, <i>l’Antro</i>; etc. A figure may
appear in more than one <i>grado</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Referring to this book in his treatise on imitation, he
says: “By topics and images I have arranged all the
headings that may suffice to group and to subserve all
human conceptions.” In the same treatise he even thinks
of painting and sculpture as proceeding by topics: genus,
sex, age, function, anatomy, light and shadow, attitude
and action, adaptation to place. Topics can no farther go.
Camillo’s system, moreover, hardly touches composition;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
all its manifold application is to style. Thus the more
readily he accepts the common Renaissance confusion of
poetic with rhetoric.</p>

<p>Another Ciceronian treatise on imitation is Bartolomeo
Ricci’s (<i>Bartholomaei Riccii de imitatione libri tres ad
Alfonsum Atestium Principem, suum in literis alumnum,
Herculis II Ferrariensium Principis filium ...</i> Venice,
1545). Written ostensibly for the guidance of his pupil
Alfonso, it is a discussion, not a textbook; but in the back
of the author’s mind is the prevalent conception of writing
Latin as writing themes. The examples quote prose
and poetry side by side without distinction of poetic from
rhetoric. The usual complimentary references to contemporaries
and to recognized previous humanists give the
schoolmaster opportunity to exhibit his wide acquaintance.
Poliziano is cited as challenging imitation; but his arguments
are not given, nor the fact that his challenge was of
Ciceronianism. Instead of citing his letter to Cortesi, Ricci
merely praises Cortesi’s reply as elegant. The <i>Ciceronianus</i>
of Erasmus is similarly dismissed as an attack on Longueil.
The progress of the book is generally from definition of
imitation (I) through application of it in composition
(II) to application in style (III). Ciceronianism, implied
throughout, first in classicism, then by increasing use of
Cicero as a model, is explicitly declared in III and supported
by a long defense of Longueil.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Imitation, practiced in all human activities, is accepted
in literature. Though Catullus in the marriage of Thetis and
in the desolation of Ariadne said the last word and every
word, nevertheless Vergil imitated him in Dido; and each has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
his own merits. [The Catullus passages are stock citations of
the period.] Cicero and Vergil both counseled and practiced
imitation. Why reduce following nature to following yourself?
Following nature demands no more than being natural,
i.e., verisimilitude. [The quibble here between nature in the
sense of human nature and nature in the sense of one’s own
nature (<i>ingenium</i>) is unpardonable. Further, it is not clear
what either has to do with imitation.] Imitate the best authors,
each in his own kind. There follows a summary of Latin literature.
[The book supplies no distinct definition of imitation
as a means of advancing literary control. It shows, quite
superfluously, that imitation is prevalent in the arts; it does
not define the limits and the methods of practicing it in
writing.]</p>

<p>II. A review of the revival of Augustan diction in a long
list of humanists proves nothing specific concerning imitation,
much concerning pride in humanistic Latin. Scholars,
however, are not well paid. Doctors and lawyers write bad
Latin. Teachers are incompetent. The vernacular has come
even into the schools; and even Cicero is translated. Let us
all combine to save Latin style. Imitation is not repetition, not
copy; there must be variation. Imitation with Plautus and
Terence was the taking of Greek plots [a very inexact account].
Vergil imitated Homer even to the lifting of passages,
and made a better tempest. Cicero imitated the Greek
orators. Vergil used the <i>Pharmaceutria</i> of Theocritus. [He did
not imitate it.] Vergil’s use of Cato and Varro adds beauty
of style. [Is this imitation, or simply use of material?]
Sallust’s Catiline is admirable; but it did not preclude Cicero’s.
So, even after Lucretius, Ovid and Vergil treated the gods.
[Here is mere confusion. Cicero did not imitate Sallust; he
wrote on the same subject.] The exposure of Andromeda is
told by Manilius, Ovid, and Pontanus; and the last did it
best. Comparison of Vergil’s Dido with the Ariadne of Catullus
is followed by another <i>comparatio</i> without enlightening us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
as to the nature or the method of imitation. Rehearsal of
literary forms (history, exposition, pleading) leads to the assertion
that Cicero is the best model in all three styles.</p>

<p>III. Let us take Cicero, then, for our model. Proverbs, epigrams,
definitions may be lifted as familiar enough to be
common property. How to make variations on the model is
exemplified abundantly in sentence form and in diction by
both prose and verse. The book closes with many analyzed
examples from Longueil, to rebut the charge that his writing
is mere <i>cento</i>, or <i>pastiche</i>, and to exhibit him as the perfect
Ciceronian. Ricci appends a practical hint from his own experience.
His habit is to start boys with Terence because the
plots are interesting, then to add some Cicero, and finally to
give them Cicero alone.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The demonstration of Longueil’s eloquence is rather an
epilogue than a conclusion. It does not suffice to justify
Ciceronianism, much less to explain imitation. The character
of imitation, its limits, its profitable methods, are
left still vague.</p>

<p>Of the same year is Bernardino Tomitano’s <i>Discussions
of Tuscan</i> (<i>Ragionamenti della lingua toscana ...</i> Venice,
1545). The sub-title goes on: “wherein the talk is of the
perfect vernacular orator and poet ... divided into three
books. In the first, philosophy is proved necessary to the
acquisition of rhetoric and poetic; in the second are set
forth the precepts of the orator; and in the third, the laws
pertaining to the poet and to good writing in both prose
and verse.”</p>

<p>A dialogue in form, with an academy setting, this is
largely a monologue by Speroni with interruptions, and
is devoted mainly to “the perfect orator and poet.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
book is a stilted and diffuse digest of conventional
rhetoric jumbled with poetic, with examples under each
conventional heading. Petrarch is made the exemplar of
everything, even of argumentation. The idea of poetic as
a distinct mode of composition never even enters.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Sperone Speroni, the protagonist, is made to repeat his
contention that language study is not the gateway to philosophy
and his epigram: “things make men wise; words make
them seem so.” Tomitano apparently takes him to mean that
philosophy feeds style, not style philosophy; for Tomitano
goes on to exhibit Petrarch as full of philosophy and perfect
in style. Dante is less careful, but Petrarch is a treasury for
all writers.</p>

<p>II. The anxiety to exhibit Petrarch leads to strange rendering
of the conventional divisions of rhetoric. <i>Inventio</i>, “first
of those five strings on which the orator makes smoothest
harmony,” is “imagining things that have truth, or at least
verisimilitude,” and is forthwith confused with <i>dispositio</i>
(<i>compartimento</i>). Petrarch exemplifies not only <i>exordium</i> and
<i>narratio</i>, but even proof and rebuttal. Of the “three styles”
of oratory the highest is Boccaccio’s in <i>Fiammetta</i>, the median
in the <i>Decameron</i>. But since among verse forms the highest
are <i>canzone</i>, <i>sestina</i>, and <i>madriale</i>; the plainest, <i>ballata</i>, <i>stanza</i>,
and <i>capitolo</i>; the sonnet, Petrarch’s favorite form, must be
median. Under style the doctrine of “tone-color” is easily reduced
to unintentional absurdity.</p>

<p>III. The distinction of poet from orator is discovered at
great length to be—verse. The Ferrarese are best in comedies,
the Venetians in sonnets, the Marchigiani in <i>capitoli</i>, they of
Vicenza in <i>ballate</i>, the Romans in odes and hymns, the Paduans
in tragedies, the Florentines in blank verse. <i>Inventio</i> in poetry
is the rehearsal of myths, of which the poet is lord and
guardian. An interruption! How can you put Petrarch above
Dante when you began by urging that the poet should be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
philosopher? Answer (240): Petrarch had all the philosophy
he needed, and used it more poetically. Though Dante was
the greater philosopher, Petrarch was the better poet. When
Aristotle calls Sophocles more perfect than Euripides, he does
not mean in style [!]. In poetry <i>dispositio</i> is evenness, consistency,
harmony; and <i>narratio</i> has the same rules as in
oratory. Horace’s precepts, to begin <i>in mediis</i>, to combine instruction
with charm, to seek advice, and to revise, are all
repeated. On a request for more about style follows a discussion
of words, simple and compound, proper and figurative,
new and old. Finally the company joins in citing many examples.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Having run out of headings, Tomitano thus runs down.
He had not in the least profited by the revival of Cicero
and Quintilian.</p>

<p>Renaissance Platonism, disputing Aristotle’s philosophy,
attacked also his rhetoric. Francesco Patrizzi (1529-1597)
published in his youth a collection of ten vernacular
dialogues on rhetoric (<i>Della retorica, dieci
dialoghi</i>, Venice, 1552), “in which,” the sub-title adds,
“the talk is of the art of oratory, with reasons impugning
the opinion held of it by ancient writers.” The Platonic
dialogue, followed superficially, is quite beyond Patrizzi’s
achievement. Discussing oratory (I) at large, he goes on
to its materials (II, III, IV), its ornaments (V), its
divisions (VI), the quality of the orator (VII), the art
of oratory (VIII), the perfect rhetoric (IX), and rhetorical
amplification (X). Evidently neither a logical
division nor a sequence, these categories are rather successive
openings for attack. Patrizzi appears not only as a
Platonist, but as an anti-Aristotelian. His main quarrels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
are with the scope of Aristotle’s <i>Rhetoric</i>, with the doctrine
of imitation, and with making rhetoric an art.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">As to scope and materials Aristotle is inconsistent. He says
both that the orator has no material and that he has all materials
(25). Why, then, did he spend most of his <i>Rhetoric</i> on
teaching the materials, slighting the ends, the ideas, the forms,
the instruments, and omitting <i>status</i>? [The misinterpretation
amounts to gross misstatement.] Perhaps we lack any clear
definition of the orator because professors insist on including
under a single word all sorts of discourse (27). Even the
oratorical ornaments are not peculiar to the orator. His materials
are the same as the economist’s, the historian’s, the poet’s
(37). Having given oratory so much scope, how can Aristotle
restrict it to three kinds? (60). [Evidently superficial,
this is rather quarrel and quibble than refutation.]</p>

<p>As to imitation, Patrizzi holds that a painter represents not
his conception (<i>concetto</i>), but the objects themselves [a
heresy that reappeared as lately as Ruskin’s “pathetic fallacy”].
Taking no pains to understand what the Aristotelian imitation
means, and ignoring the obvious fact that it is applied to
poetic, he thus dismisses it by denial.</p>

<p>Similarly he finds that rhetoric is not an art because Plato
says it is merely a skill (<i>peritia</i>).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The significance of this work is that in 1552 a Venetian
seeking recognition at twenty-two could use some distinguished
names in dialogues smartly rapping Aristotle,
and even find a publisher.</p>

<p>The English rhetoric of Thomas Wilson (<i>The art of
rhetorique, for the use of all such as are studious of
eloquence, set forth in English</i>, London, 1553 [reprinted
down to 1593; ed. G. H. Mair, Oxford, 1909]) covers
the ancient scheme practically, using Cicero and Quintilian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
as well as the <i>Rhetorica ad Herennium</i>, and deriving
much from Erasmus.</p>

<p>The <i>Partitiones oratoriae</i> (Venice and Paris, 1558) of
Jacopo Brocardo is exactly described by its sub-title as
<i>elegans et dilucida paraphrasis</i> of Aristotle’s <i>Rhetoric</i>.
Now translating, now paraphrasing, it provides in its
marginal headings a sufficient table of contents.</p>

<p>But the revival of the full classical tradition is most
obvious in the comprehensive Italian rhetoric of Bartolomeo
Cavalcanti (<i>La retorica</i>, 1555; second edition,
Venice, 1558/9, reprinted Pesaro, 1574). Through 563
closely printed pages this is strictly and consistently a
rhetoric of the classical character and scope. The exceptional
avoidance of confusion with poetic appears in the
bare mention of Vergil and in the ousting of Petrarch
from his monopoly as exemplar of everything desirable in
prose as well as in verse. Plato is rare; Plutarch, rarer.
The main body of analyzed examples is from the orations
of Cicero. Demosthenes is only less frequent. From Livy
and Thucydides the examples are usually of the imaginary
harangues to troops. All the examples that are not themselves
Italian are translated. Hermogenes is cited some
half-dozen times; Quintilian, twice as often; but the main
source of doctrine is the <i>Rhetoric</i> of Aristotle and, next
to that, his Logic. The book is constantly and consistently
Aristotelian.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Instead of devoting himself after the Renaissance habit
mainly to style, Cavalcanti gives it only one of his seven
books (V). All the rest are spent on composition. Book I is
a lucid survey of the field; II shows the ways of <i>inventio</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
each of the three types of oratory; III deals with argument;
IV, with appeal to emotion and to moral habit; V, besides
the usual lists of figures, has an unusually definite treatment
of sentence management (<i>compositio</i>) and a meager summary
of <i>dispositio</i>; VI presents the typical parts of an oration,
avoiding the common confusion of <i>narratio</i> (statement
of the facts) with narrative; VII deals with confirmation and
conclusion. Its incidental recurrence to <i>dispositio</i> is again
vague. Cavalcanti had excuse enough in the ancient tradition,
which is generally weakest in its counsels for sequence.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Fortunately Cavalcanti’s own plan is clear and fairly
progressive; and his adjustment to his own time appears
in the prominence given to the third of the ancient types
of oratory, such speeches on occasion as were the main
Renaissance field. His defect is the common Renaissance
vice of diffuseness. Beyond its intrinsic value Cavalcanti’s
<i>Retorica</i> has historical significance. It gave the wider
audience a just and distinct view of classical rhetoric.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century closed with the full classical
doctrine operative in the <i>Ratio studiorum</i> and in the
<i>Rhetoric</i> of Soarez.</p>

<span class="smaller">IMITATION IN LYRIC AND PASTORAL</span></h2>

</div>

<h3 id="Chapter_IV_1">1. LYRIC</h3>

<p>The lyrics of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries show
an extensive revival of Augustan measures in Latin.
Meantime imitation of Petrarch made him an Italian
classic and a European model. Thus, in England, revival
from a meager and languid fifteenth century was stimulated
in the sixteenth by Italy. But France shows the
history of vernacular lyric in clearest stages: (1) in the
formalizing of medieval modes by the <i>rhétoriqueurs</i>; (2)
in the verse forms and diction of Lemaire and Marot,
seeking variety without rejecting tradition; (3) in the
Pléiade program of revolt from tradition to classicism,
and especially in Ronsard’s experiments with the Greek
ode; (4) in the final predominance of the sonnet.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_IV_1a">(<i>a</i>) <i>Latin Lyric</i></h4>

<p>Latin lyric was both changed in mode by the Renaissance
and increased in volume. The fifteenth century
turned from the modes of the medieval Latin lyric to
more direct imitation of Vergil and Ovid, Catullus and
Horace. Meantime the tradition of writing Latin verse in
school continued to make every Renaissance author
familiar with this metric. The difference was that he now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
used it in his own mature composition. For humanism
demanded even of vernacular poets such Latin stanzas as
might introduce the works of their friends, compliment
their patrons, or celebrate state weddings, victories, and
solemn entries. Though even published Latin lyrics were
often themes, they at least promoted and confirmed two
pervasive Renaissance literary habits: control of classical
metric, and imitation. Throughout the Renaissance there
is to be assumed in the back of a poet’s mind a fund of
classical measures and phrases.</p>

<p>But Renaissance Latin lyrics are by no means all
themes. For some poets Latin was really the lyric medium.
Humanistic anxiety and pretense about classical diction
might, indeed, hinder lyric, but could not suppress it.
Pontano (1426-1503), whose Latin poems fill nearly
seven hundred modern pages, wrote not a few as directly
and utterly lyrical as his <i>Naenia</i>. Jan Everaerts of Mechlin,
known to literature as Secundus (1511-1536), even
started a lyric vogue in Italy and France, and later in
England, with his <i>Basia</i>. Obviously inspired by Catullus,
they had a quality and influence of their own.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_IV_1b">(<i>b</i>) <i>Italy and England</i></h4>

<p>The progress of vernacular lyric was steadiest in Italy
because there the vernacular triumph had been recognized
earliest and most consistently. The medieval lyric forms
derived generically from Provençal—<i>canzone</i>, <i>ballata</i>,
<i>sestina</i>, and <i>sonetto</i>—had all been explored by Dante;
and one of them, the sonnet, had received from Petrarch
a stamp that gave it European currency. Beside the humanist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
cult of Augustan Latin rose a cult of Petrarch as a
vernacular classic. From Petrarch himself and through
his fifteenth-century imitators the sonnet became the most
widespread lyric mode both for a single, self-sufficient
lyric and as a lyric unit in a narrative chain.</p>

<p>In England, where the range of medieval stanzas had
been narrower, fifteenth-century lyric was meager. “The
age of transition,” as it has been called apologetically, was
a period of medieval decadence, of stalling in medieval
patterns. Without much stir of ideas, without general
sureness in verse technic, it is often diffuse and straggling,
as in Lydgate. Skelton’s Latin learning remained quite
apart from his slack and boisterous English verse; and
English fifteenth-century lyric generally is both conventional
and feeble. The sixteenth-century revival that was
sought in Petrarch led here, as elsewhere, to the prevalence
of sonnets. Its pioneer was Sir Thomas Wiat (1503-1542).
Starting with that connection of lyric with music
which was to be a preoccupation of Ronsard, appreciating
Chaucer, but reading him in imperfect texts, he turned
early from a few <i>rondeaux</i> of the Marot type to the
Petrarchan sonnet. Two thirds of his sonnets are translations
or echoes of Petrarch himself, or are derived from
his imitators. Wiat pursued Italian further in octaves and
<i>terza rima</i> and seems to have read, besides Ariosto, Alamanni,
Navagero, and Castiglione, the <i>Poetica</i> of Trissino
(1529). The previous century had brought Italian influences
on English learning; Wiat brought the first
clearly literary influence since Boccaccio’s on Chaucer. His
friend Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (1517-1547), carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
this forward. Similarly following Petrarch and the
Petrarchans, and experimenting with <i>terza rima</i> and other
stanzas, he made Italian metric more familiar, and in
particular helped to establish among the Elizabethans that
form of sonnet which is called Shaksperian.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_IV_1c">(<i>c</i>) <i>France</i></h4>

<p>France shows most distinctly the whole Renaissance
lyric history. The beginning of the history in the medieval
vernacular art of refrain stanzas had shown there the
most systematic elaboration. In 1501 Antoine Vérard
printed at Paris the huge collection of <i>balades</i>, <i>rondeaux</i>,
and <i>virelais</i> entitled <i>Le jardin de plaisance et fleur de
rhétorique</i>. <i>Rhétorique</i>, or more specifically <i>seconde rhétorique</i>,
means the art of verse; the introduction expounds
this in an anonymous treatise. Pierre Fabri incorporated
the treatise in his <i>Grande et vraie art de pleine rhétorique</i>
(Rouen, 1521). The <i>pleine</i> signifies merely the inclusion
of both prose (Part I) and verse (Part II). Fullness in
any other sense is hardly to be found in the <i>rhétoriques</i>
of the period. They furnish mainly figures of speech and
verse forms. They are style books; for the so-called school
of the <i>rhétoriqueurs</i> was devoted mainly to verbal and
metrical ingenuities.</p>

<p>But as Villon had shown in the early fifteenth century
that the <i>balade</i> was not dead, so as the century waned Jean
Lemaire (1473 to about 1520) was poet enough to be
more than <i>rhétoriqueur</i>. True, he continued the jingling
iteration. A double virelay composed on two rhymes begins
as follows:</p>

<p>But the whole allegorical scheme of that poem is as
medieval as Chaucer’s in the <i>Parlement of Foules</i>. For
Lemaire still uses mythology not for classical allusion,
but medievally as an extension of allegory. Chaos and the
Furies, Hymen, Erebus, Mercury, and Janus are listed
(pp. 172-173) with the personifications Honor, Grace,
Victory, and Discord. The medieval adaptation brings
from the <i>Roman de la Rose</i> Bel-Accueil to be a sub-deacon
in the temple of Venus (p. 252); for the temple, as in
Chaucer, is a church and has relics. Even Hippolytus is a
“<i>saint martyr</i>” (p. 223); and the three goddesses at the
judgment of Paris are domesticated in Flanders by their
“<i>venustes corpulences</i>.” Jean Lemaire was not a forerunner
of classicism.</p>

<p>Nor was Clement Marot (1495-1544). He learned the
sonnet in Lyon and in Italy without discerning either its
distinctive value or its future. For him it was merely one
more form of the epigram type seen also in the <i>dizaine</i>.
He continued the <i>balade</i>, adapted the <i>rondeau</i>, wrote
much encomium without ever proclaiming himself a <i>vates</i>.
His epistles, elegies, epigrams, his experiments with
Alexandrines, his imitations of Martial, suggest a more
normal development than the Pléiade change of both
emphasis and direction.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>For the new day of the sonnet at Lyon we must look
to Louise Labé (about 1520-1566). Bourgeoise of the
commercial and literary, French and Italian city of Lyon,
composing sometimes in Italian and sometimes in French,
she speaks the choice language of culture without parade.
Her sonnets<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> are directly and utterly lyric. Their literary
derivations may, indeed, be found, but are never put forward.
Her few classical allusions are all familiar. The
simple mythology of her prose <i>Débat de Folie et d’Amour</i>
is handled in the Burgundian fashion of Jean Lemaire.
Her verse is Petrarchan as it were inevitably, because that
was the prevalent mode of her place and time. To call her
a precursor of the Pléiade, then, may be quite misleading;
for she suggests neither school nor date.</p>

<p>French humanism had still to attempt a stricter classicism,
not adapting but imitating, not domesticating but
importing. Ancient gods were to be recalled in the style
of Vergil or of Ovid. Odes were to be Horatian, and
might be Pindaric. Lyric diction was to be “enriched” by
the interweaving of correct allusions in classical phrase.
The allusive value would thus be heightened by summoning
the hearer’s culture to answer the poet’s. Since poetry
would be elevated by becoming learned, poets should be
<i>docte</i>. As for readers insufficiently educated, they were
not to be considered. Ronsard repeated Horace’s <i>Odi
profanum vulgus et arceo</i>. Let the poet seek “fit audience,
though few.” This whole theory of poetic allusion seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
to our age exploded. It comes to us through that standardized
eighteenth-century poetic diction which was repudiated
by the romantic revolt. Modern readers, consequently
out of tune, must approach many Renaissance lyrics with
a resolution of tolerance. Aurora leaving the bed of
Tithonus, though mere decoration in Vergil and somewhat
faded in the Middle Age, was not yet stale to the
increasing audience of the sixteenth century. But if the
allusion, far from being stale, were unfamiliar, even
recondite? Instead of rejecting classical allusions <i>a priori</i>
as hindrances to lyric, we may learn to estimate their value
from actual Renaissance experience. That the language of
poetry should be reminiscent of Greece and Rome was a
Renaissance postulate.</p>

<p>Ronsard’s early classicism, revolting from prolonged
<i>rhétorique</i>, was reminiscent of Vergil and Ovid of course,
of Catullus and his imitator Secundus, sometimes of
Claudian and Pontano, but mainly of the Odes of Horace.
Sometimes he even paraphrases, as when he composes a
French <i>Fons Bandusiae</i>; often he adapts phrases; oftenest
he follows the Horatian lyric movement. If he occasionally
condescends to a medieval form, he gives it classical style.
Further, his study of Greek under Dorat led him to imitate
Callimachus and then Pindar. The reminiscences of
Callimachus hardly go beyond the usual Renaissance lifting
of phrase or allusion, that verbal classicism which was
the habit of the time; but from Pindar he learned something
different.</p>

<p>The extant poetry of Pindar is almost all encomium of
victors at the pan-Hellenic contests. Encomium was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
poetic fashion in the Renaissance too, because it was a
means of publication. The Greeks had justified it by the
poet’s mission to confer fame. Though Ronsard adopts
the idea in haughty proclamation of his own high function,
he had already ancient warrant enough in Horace.
What he learned further from Pindar was technical, a
wider range of lyric composition. Encomium, reduced to
recipe in late Greek oratory, took definite form earlier in
Greek poetry. The main topics for the Pindaric celebration
of an Olympian victor are his family line and his
native city. Each of these is carried into legend and myth,
either by allusions to what the pan-Hellenic audience
knew as common tradition, or in the longer odes by verse
narrative. The poem often ended on exhortation to live
worthily of past and present fame. These conventional
motives Pindar carried out metrically in a sequence of
strophes and antistrophes. Without examining how
strictly Ronsard followed the Greek mode, it is enough
to say that his French adaptation proceeds by triads:
strophe, antistrophe, epode. Though he usually followed
Pindar’s shorter odes, his Ode to the King on the Peace
(1550) has ten triads; his Ode to Michel de l’Hospital
(1550), twenty-four. In the latter the young Muses sing
to Jupiter the battle of the Olympians with the Titans;
and there follows an historical vision of the progress of
poesy. Thus the Greek scheme invited Ronsard to wider
adventures in metric, to more remote recurrences and
larger lyric harmonies than were offered by Horace.</p>

<p>Though the metrical experiment ceased abruptly with
Ronsard in 1550, it had later fruit in Spenser. Longer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
poems of occasion, thus introduced from the Greek by so
skillful a metrist, were carried by the Pléiade influence
to England. But Spenser’s <i>Epithalamion</i> (1595) and
<i>Prothalamion</i>, instead of conforming specifically to Ronsard’s
verse system, follow more generally and more variously
the idea of larger metrical reach by framing a
stanza of eighteen lines.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Why did Ronsard drop such measures in 1550 at the
age of twenty-seven? The Pindaric ode recurs sporadically
in vernacular poetry, and occasionally has had a limited
vogue. More or less Greek, it is often, as with Ronsard,
learned and often pretentious with airs of inspiration.
One of its rare successes came more than two centuries
later in England with Gray. It has never kept its hold in
lyric poetry. Ronsard continued to print his Pindarics
among his collected poems; but he never again composed
in those lyric modes. Had he found them intractable to his
language or to his own bent? Having pushed allusiveness
beyond the ken of any considerable audience, had he
learned that lyric is remote at its peril? We may guess
part of the answer from the times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>Renaissance lyric thrived on learning so long as it was
addressed to a special audience and sought reputation with
patrons to whom learning might be useful in their dependents.
The poet courtier naturally flattered princes or
their ministers by assuming their familiarity with the
classics as he displayed his own. But the printers had been
widening the audience. Though 1550 was too early for
what we now call a reading public, there was a widening
circle, especially in the commercial cities, of readers who
had some culture and desired more. Poets could begin to
address these directly. Forty years later Spenser, still practicing
encomium to win a position in which he could
write, felt an English reading public and harmonized a
long stanza without exhibiting Greek metric. Though
Renaissance lyric remained largely aristocratic, even Ronsard,
aristocrat himself, might find the mission of dispensing
fame smaller than the opportunity of wider
hearing.</p>

<p>For such wider appeal the readiest mode was the sonnet.
Accepting Marot’s scheme, Ronsard restricted his own
practice to a few types especially suited to music. In thus
using the new polyphonic art of voice with string accompaniment
he applied the ancient idea of a sung lyric to
the actual singing of his time. Modulating his many
sonnets expertly, he showed equal control in other stanzas.
That these familiar forms became a fitter pattern for Ronsard
than the ode seems to us demonstrated by literary
history. His Pindarics have been relegated to the museum;
his more acclimated Horatian odes have been neglected;
but time has not dimmed:</p>

</div>

<p>Life is short; “gather ye roses while ye may”; the
theme is perennial, a lyric commonplace. The rendering of
it has often been conventional, but often, as here, individual
because intensely realized. The sonnet is direct,
immediate, in renouncing all elaboration and all distraction.
There are no allusions, only images. Candlelight,
hearth, loom, song, spoken words, are the sharper because
they are unmodified. There are few adjectives. The lyric is
simplified. But the images of attitude and gesture are
iterated to lead the mood: “assise auprès du feu, dévidant
et filant,” “à demi sommeillant ... réveillant,” “accroupie.”
This is the diction of the lyrics that have no
date. For the point is not the abstract superiority of the
sonnet as a verse form; it is the appeal of form and diction
alike to a wider audience, the communication of poetry
rather than its exhibition. Ronsard shows this power of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
direct appeal in his equally popular <i>Mignonne, allons
voir si la rose</i>. Included in his first book of odes, this has
no Greek strangeness. By 1550, having explored more
remote modes to answer the special demand of his circle
and his own bent toward learning, he returned to the lyric
forms that had become familiar.</p>

<p>The sonnet sequence, the use of the sonnet as a lyric
unit in a progress suggesting narrative, was more distinctly
developed in England. Though Ronsard’s sonnets
appear in series, as addressed to Cassandre, Marie, or
Hélène, the enchaining is more evident in Sidney’s <i>Astrophel
and Stella</i> and in Shakspere. Spenser, fully aware
of the Pléiade, gave himself no such strict schooling as
Ronsard’s. He usually stopped short of ancient stanza
and of borrowed phrase. But he relied longer on mythological
allusions. Thus he decorated not only the <i>Faerie
Queene</i>, but even his lyric triumph, the <i>Epithalamion</i>.
Ronsard’s later verse makes slighter and more considerate
use of such ornament; Spenser’s last poem still turns to
the nymphs, to Jupiter and Leda, and to Hesper. The
Renaissance lyric experience may be summed up in these
two poets. Devoted to national revival of vernacular
poetry, nourished by Latin and by Greek antiquity, expert
metrists, they show together the limits of imitative
classicism. Responding to the special demands of their
time, they used the classics to certify their learning. Thus
their lyric medium was surcharged. Its forms were sometimes
so strange, its diction often so overloaded, as to
sacrifice lyric directness, especially the immediate transmission
of sensations. Lyric allusiveness was pushed beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
its lyric value. With lesser poets it often sufficed as
an end in itself. Renaissance “enrichment” often became
mere decorative dilation. But Ronsard, and then Spenser,
lived to fuse their experience of classicism in their appeal
to coming lovers of poetry.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_IV_2">2. PASTORAL</h3>

<p>Pastoral is an old dream. Classified by modern psychology
as escape, it has been in various forms the poetry
of the city wistful for the country. The word, denoting
shepherds, at the same time connotes that its shepherds
are not real, but fictitious. Whether allegorized or otherwise
manipulated, they are not the actual men who
throughout history have tended beasts by day and night
in the open, not actual Sicilians, not even the shepherds
who in the Nativity plays brought English toys to the
infant Saviour. All these are real; the shepherds of
pastoral, wearing shepherd’s clothes, sing other songs.
Artificial, indeed, pastoral has often been, and is easily,
but not always, not necessarily. The city dream of the
country “simple life” is after all a recurrent fact. Though
it may be sentimentalized, conventionalized, rhetoricated,
so may the other dreams. Instead of ruling out this one,
we may examine its literary vitality. Besides, it has a
special claim. Pastoral, ranging all the way from lyric
through narrative to dramatic, and from Alexandrian
Greek to Elizabethan English, offered in its Renaissance
vogue a wide school of imitation.</p>

<p>Renaissance taste in Greek inclined to that later literature
called Alexandrian: to neo-Platonism, to the rhetoric<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
of Hermogenes, to Callimachus oftener than to Pindar,
to the Byzantine imitators of Anacreon and the Byzantine
Anthology of epigrams, to the descriptive show-pieces
inserted in that late oratory called sophistic and in the
“Greek Romances,” both the long melodramas narrated
by Apollonius, Heliodorus, and Tatius and the idyllic
<i>Daphnis and Chloe</i> of that Longus who was called “the
sophist.” But the Renaissance literary creed for Latin was
classicism. Inclined rather to the dilation of such later
poets as Lucan, and even to Ausonius and Claudian, the
Renaissance professed its faith in the artistic restraint of
Vergil. Now pastoral had the promise of reconciling
Alexandria with imperial Rome. It could turn for decoration
both to the sophists and to Ovid. It was both Theocritus
and Vergil.</p>

<p>The extant poems of Theocritus are by no means all
pastoral. Called Idylls, that is little poems, they are love
lyrics (II, III, XX); epigrams, that is, inscriptions of the
sort collected in the <i>Anthology</i> (XXVIII and the following);
myths (I in part, XI, XIII, XXIV-V); encomia
(XIV in part, XVI-XVIII, XXII); and mimes, that is,
dramatic dialogues (X, XV). Only seven of those that
are surely his are such poetry-matches between shepherds
as came to be called eclogues (I, IV-VII, X in part,
XIV). Though this charming variety has suggested to
modern critics hints for later pastoral development, especially
toward drama, the vivacious realistic dialogue
(XV) between two city women at the festival of Adonis
is essentially different from pastoral. Nor is it true to
either poet to say that pastoral with Theocritus was fresh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
and natural; with Vergil it became artificial. Both poets
knew the country, Vergil apparently better than Theocritus;
but neither gives it that direct, immediate expression
which in modern times has been called nature poetry.
Theocritus is specific with wild olive, peas, and acorns;
sometimes concrete with a smoky hen-roost, waving
green leaves, or a crested lark. For an Alexandrian he is
exceptionally free from the dilation of descriptive show-pieces;
but he has the Alexandrian habit of seeing nature
through art. Gorgo and Praxinoa (XV) are conveyed by
their chatter; and the dirge to Adonis describes the <i>putti</i>
on the ceremonial coverlet as like fledgling nightingales
trying their wings. Sicily is romantic for us with blue sea,
wild uplands, and volcanic steeps. The shepherds of
Theocritus live nearer to sophisticated Syracuse or Agrigentum,
or to the other western cities of ancient Greece.
Unlike enough otherwise, Theocritus and Vergil are alike
in viewing the country through the eyes of the city.</p>

<p>The <i>Bucolics</i> of Vergil established pastoral in its most
familiar pattern. One of the few schoolbooks to hold
their place from ancient into modern times, they have
drilled into successive thousands the poetic scheme of a
lyric contest for some rustic prize, and the idea that this
contest, symbolizing some other more momentous, may
express the poet’s own hopes and fears. Thus in school,
as from time immemorial boys got their first notions of
worldly wisdom by memorizing Latin beast-fables, so they
learned Latin grammar, with Latin verse, from shepherd
rivalries typifying wider struggles. Since many Renaissance
boys continued to imitate the <i>Bucolics</i> when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
grew up, many Renaissance eclogues are published
themes. That Vergil’s eclogues have survived all this is
evidence of immortality. They need no further praise;
but having been used for grammar, they need to be read
again for poetry and for literary history.</p>

<p>The inspiration of Theocritus, gracefully acknowledged
by Vergil (IV, VI, X), is hardly of style. The avoidance
of descriptive dilation, the preference of specific indication
to ornament, are Vergil’s own choice.</p>

<p class="noindent">More concise than Theocritus in style, and graver, he is
quite independent in composition. The <i>Pharmaceutria</i>
(VIII) owes to the second idyll of Theocritus little but
the subject. The encomium of <i>Pollio</i> (IV), instead of
following the sophistic recipe item by item, selects and
weaves into an integrated vision of the Golden Age. But
such economy of phrase and movement seems to have had
less influence in making his eclogues models than his use
of shepherd rivalries to suggest larger struggles and
personal concerns.</p>

<p>Moralized eclogue was familiar from the schoolbook
called <i>Auctores octo</i>. As used at Troyes in 1436, this
collection contained, with an <i>Isopet</i> (Aesop’s fables), a
<i>Cathonet</i> (maxims of Cato), and other medieval compends,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
a <i>Théodolet</i>. The work thus familiarly styled is
<i>Theodulus</i> (or <i>Liber Theoduli</i>), <i>ecloga qua comparantur
miracula Veteris Testamenti cum veterum poetarum commentis</i>.
It matches pagan with Christian instances in a
contest of Falsehood (Pseustis) with Truth (Alethia)
which is judged by Reason (Phronesis). Probably of the
ninth century, it was printed as late as the sixteenth.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Literary use of Latin eclogues during the intervening
centuries is sufficiently indicated by Dante’s in reply to
Giovanni di Virgilio. Petrarch’s Vergilian <i>Bucolicum
carmen</i> expresses the actual conflict of Christian with
pagan poetry. Boccaccio’s eclogues are less distinctive
than his Italian prose narrative <i>Ameto</i>. Though this is far
longer than any previous pastoral and is dilated with
lavish description, it must be remembered not only for its
pastoral setting, but for its alternations of verse and for
its myth. The successive interviews of the shepherd with
the nymphs and demigoddesses symbolize the progress
from earthly to heavenly love.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>But humanism must have its own eclogues and its
own symbolism. The eclogues (1498) of Mantuan
(Baptista Spagnolo, known as Mantuanus, 1448-1513)
were lifted out of the humanist throng by being adopted
for use in school. The imitation thus invited through some
two hundred years was the easier because they are far
less concise than Vergil’s. Vicar General of the Carmelites,
Mantuan doubtless owed some of his vogue to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
edification. Nevertheless he admits that classicizing which
Erasmus attacked later as paganizing: <i>Tonans</i>, for instance,
or <i>Regnator Olympi</i> for God. Eclogue III presents
the convention of hopeless, ill-starred love; IX, the conventional
contrast of country to city; but X makes the
shepherds debate the actual controversy over the Observantists.
Eclogue IV finds women still, as of old, <i>servile
genus</i>, <i>crudele</i>, <i>superbum</i>. Most of its examples being
classical, boys could learn simultaneously to recognize
allusions and to beware women. Mantuan occasionally
indulges in word-play.</p>

<p class="noindent">But generally he is as accomplished in ease as in classicism.</p>

<p>Six years after Mantuan’s collection, another Italian
writer of Latin eclogues, Jacopo Sannazaro (1458-1530),
published a vernacular pastoral, <i>Arcadia</i> (1504),<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> so
widely popular as to become almost the sixteenth-century
type. Though the name is Greek, Arcadia and Arcadian
have been ever since reminiscent of Sannazaro. Through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
him, more than through any other single influence, vernacular
pastoral spread over western Europe. For he
gathered up in prose narrative with verse interludes most
of what pastoral in its long history had become. Saturated
in Vergil, familiar among the other Latin poets and with
Greek, he had caught the possibilities of Boccaccio’s
<i>Ameto</i>; and though he weaves throughout from literature,
never directly from life, he was artist enough to weave
originally. The <i>Arcadia</i> shows Renaissance imitation at its
best.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Apter most often to attract the eye are the tall and spreading
trees reared by nature on rugged mountains than the cultivated
plants pruned by expert hands in decorative gardens;
and much apter to please the ear the wild birds singing on
green branches amid solitary thickets than among city crowds
the trained ones in winsome and decorated cages. For which
reason the woodland songs, too, methinks, inscribed in the
stiff bark of beeches no less delight the reader than the choice
verses written on the fair pages of illuminated volumes; and
the waxed reeds of the shepherds in their flowery valleys offer
perchance a pleasanter sound than the polished and vaunted
instruments of the musicians in halls of ceremony. And who
doubts that more attractive to human minds is a fountain
springing naturally from the living rock, surrounded by green
herbage, than all the others made by art of whitest marble
resplendent with gold? Surely, as I believe, no one. Relying,
therefore, on this, I may well on these deserted slopes, to the
listening trees and to such few shepherds as may be there,
tell the rude eclogues springing from the vein of nature, leaving
them as bare of ornament as I heard them sung by the
shepherds of Arcadia to the liquid murmur of their fountains.
For to these not once, but a thousand times, the mountain
gods, won by their sweetness, gave attentive ear; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
tender nymphs, forgetting to chase their wandering prey, left
their quivers and bows beneath the lofty pines of Menalus
and Lycus. Whence I, if I may, would rather have the glory
of putting my lips to the humble reed of Corydon, given him
long ago by Dametas as a precious gift, than to the resounding
clarinet of Pallas, with which the presumptuous satyr challenged
Apollo to his own destruction. For surely it is better
to cultivate well a little plot than to leave a great one by ill
management foully crowded with stubble.</p>

<p>There lies toward the summit of Parthenio, no mean mountain
of shepherd Arcadia, a delectable plain, not very ample
in size, being bounded by the build of the place, but so full
of fine and greenest herbage that only the sportive flocks,
feeding there greedily, hinder perpetual verdure. [Follows a
list of its trees, with appropriate adjectives and allusions. In
spring, when the glade is at its best, shepherds meet there to
match their skill with lance or bow, with leap and rustic song.
At such a time Ergasto, moping apart, was challenged by
Selvaggio in <i>terza rima</i>.]</p>

</div>

<p>Such are the prelude to <i>Arcadia</i> and its first eclogue;
and so it continues. For the whole book is an alternating
series of prose descriptions and lyrics. There is no narrative
sequence and arrival. We are bidden to linger in
Arcadia, to move only from one grouping to another. The
alternation of prose and verse, as old as Boethius, was
new for pastoral. For its time the fluent rhythmic prose,
at once easy and regulated, was the distinctive achievement.
The verse is competent in a considerable range of
meters. Both prose and verse, whether in reminiscence of
pastoral hexameters or in feeling for a rhythm natural
to Italian speech, are largely dactylic. Meter XII ends
with a dactyl every one of its 325 lines; but Sannazaro’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
habit is no such <i>tour de force</i>. His dactyls are not insistent;
they are merely predominant in a pleasant variety. For
he is studious of variation. In the first eclogue Ergasto’s
reply links some ten tercets by internal rhyme (lines
61-91):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Menando un giorno l’agni presso un fi<i>ume</i>,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and then resumes the <i>terza rima</i>. In Meter II, lines 86-96,
the responses begin by repeating the rival’s last line,
somewhat as in the refrains of popular poetry. Sannazaro
is a careful artist.</p>

<p>The diction achieves a pretty balance between ease and
suggestiveness. Easy with conventionally appropriate
adjectives and fluent cadences, it is full of echoes. At once
we are reminded of Vergil, soon of Ovid, Horace, Theocritus,
Catullus, and also of their imitators. The great
range of this appropriation can be measured by the
crowded footnotes of the commentators; but without
measuring, sometimes without distinct recognition, we
hear a constant accompaniment. Renaissance allusiveness,
too often paraded, is here subdued to serve the pastoral
mood. Vergil was in this glade. Theocritus set such a jar
for the rustic prize. This myth is prettiest in Ovid. But
though an allusion lurks under every bush, it will not leap
out to detain us. Whatever pastoral poets we know help<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
to make us yield ourselves with at least a wistful “Et ego
in Arcadia vixi.” Tasso, indeed, was to outdo him with
<i>Aminta</i>; but the difference is in degree, not in method.
In 1504 Sannazaro succeeded at the Renaissance task of
making literature out of literature.</p>

<p>Dramatic pastoral was one of the forms of Renaissance
pageantry. It put shepherds, nymphs, and satyrs on the
stage to enhance the celebration of court festivity with
scenic device and music. It gave mythology representation
without changing the pastoral type.</p>

<p>Though carefully limited in time to secure consecutive
action, Tasso’s <i>Aminta</i><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is much less dramatic than
pastoral. It weaves within the dramatic frame the pastoral
tissue of wistful reminiscence. It revives the ancient
dream of the Golden Age, not only through scenery and
the music of instruments and of verse, but by constant
allusiveness of style.</p>

<p>Within twenty-five pages Solerti’s notes record echoes
of Sappho, Theocritus, and Achilles Tatius; of Lucretius,
Vergil (oftenest), Horace, Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius,
Ovid, Seneca, Claudian, Statius, Nemesianus, Calpurnius,
Cornelius Gallus; of Dante, Petrarch (oftenest), Boccaccio,
Poliziano, Sannazaro, Bembo—but why go on? Even
so heavy a charge of reminiscence is managed without
overloading. The <i>Aminta</i> is the most consistent, as it is
perhaps the most accomplished, example of this form of
Renaissance borrowing. Tasso makes discreet use of alliteration
and of word-play. His musical verse should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
heard, not merely read. The pervasive harmony, various
and subtle, can be but suggested by underlining a few
recurrences in the opening scene.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The delicate weaving of sound and sense, allusion and
image, has not faded. Few works of the Renaissance have
had more modern admirers than the <i>Aminta</i>.</p>

<p>The continuance of the type and the spread of its vogue
appear in the twelve eclogues of the <i>Shepherds’ Calendar</i>
(1579). Spenser turned to it as to the established
European form in which to prove oneself classical and
offer one’s poetic encomium. It was the obvious medium
by which to win rank as a poet. But at once appears a
marked difference. Instead of relying on the pastoral fund
of allusion, Spenser provides an apparatus of explanation:
a dedicatory epistle, a general argument for the whole
series, a prefatory argument for each eclogue, and a gloss.
The last explains even obvious classical allusions, interprets
the allegory, indicates that this phrase is taken from
Theocritus and that from Vergil, and sometimes adds
learned references. Did English readers need all this?
The answer is not that Sidney, Leicester, Raleigh, Burleigh,
Elizabeth herself, had not read Vergil and Mantuan,
but rather that Spenser, even while he must still
depend for a living on the court, was conscious of a
wider audience. There were already English lovers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
poetry, and there were soon to be more, who, having less
culture than they desired, were glad to be guided in
Arcadia.</p>

<p>The gloss also supports Spenser’s attempt to make his
pastoral English. It explains his deliberate archaism; for
he tries to recall the language of Chaucer without quite
understanding it himself. Though of course he caught
Chaucer’s drift, he did not always catch his rhythms, nor
even his grammar. Archaism, dubious enough in itself,
is thus doubly dubious here. The diction of pastoral has
an added strangeness. Sidney deplored this in his <i>Defense
of Poesy</i>: “That same framing of his stile to an old rustick
language I dare not alowe, sith neyther <i>Theocritus</i> in
Greeke, <i>Virgill</i> in Latine, nor Sanazar in Italian did
affect it.” Ben Jonson’s dismissal may be blunt; but it is
precise: “Spenser in affecting the ancients writ no language.”
If such diction may occasionally suggest actual
country speech, it is but the farther removed from the
pastoral mood.</p>

<p>Spenser’s eclogues are English also in their nationalist
fear and scorn of Rome. Cultivated by government policy,
this was so widespread as to assure him a response. Moreover
pastoral had always expressed controversies beyond
shepherds. But pastoral allegory has been most acceptable
when it is least local. Mantuan’s Observantist discussion
and Spenser’s “Papists” have long been tedious. We
might look them up in the footnotes, if they did not
seem too remote from the concerns of the Golden Age.
For pastoral at its best is not English, nor French, nor
Italian; it is Arcadian, translatable readily into any language<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
because it has no country. Its allusiveness breaks
down when it sends us to a guidebook.</p>

<p>Otherwise Spenser’s eclogues are not distinctive. Their
verbal mythology is discreetly limited to familiar deities;
their imitation, except for one paraphrase of Marot, is of
the usual authors; their pattern is the Vergilian type. If
the April encomium of Elizabeth is fulsome, that was
the habit of her court. If the metric is sometimes disappointing
with crowded stresses, or padded rhymes, or
even jingle, that is because Spenser was experimenting.
The significance of the <i>Shepherds’ Calendar</i> is not its
pastoral achievement, but its use of the mode to win
recognition and its attempt to push pastoral farther than
it would go.</p>

<p>In spite of its pastoral title, Sir Philip Sidney’s <i>Arcadia</i>
(c. 1583) has a different pattern. Though it has incidental
pastoral, its design is that of the long, loose, complicated,
melodramatic tales of Alexandria known as the Greek
Romances. These decadent Greek prose stories had wide
circulation in the Renaissance; and one, the <i>Daphnis and
Chloe</i>, is both better organized than most of them and
clearly reminiscent of pastoral. Since its vogue was increased
by the French translation of Amyot, it may be
counted among Renaissance pastoral influences. For pastoral
has appeared again and again not as the main intention
of a whole work, but as an incidental interest.
Though Renaissance imitation was thus sometimes of
style, sometimes merely of decoration, it was also quite
clearly the study of an ancient literary form.</p>

</div>

<p>Sixteenth-century poetic has no specific relation
to Renaissance development of verse narrative.
The more pervasive counsels and habits of imitation agree
in exalting Vergil. Vergil did, indeed, guide the narrative
sequence of Tasso; but narrative sequence is not a general
Renaissance concern. Malory, Boiardo, Ariosto, Spenser,
seek other narrative values. What they have in common
preoccupation and common achievement is romance.
Romance in a period of classicism, romance written in
spite of humanism and sometimes by humanists—what
should it be? It was response to the special audience of
the courts; for, whatever humanism might say, the courts
liked romances. It was response also to the wider audience
steadily increased by printing. The response, both in
medieval continuance and in distinctive Renaissance
direction, constitutes an important chapter in literary
history.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_V_1">1. THE ROMANTIC CONTRAST</h3>

<p>The good old times recreated by poetry for refuge and
inspiration were found by Malory and Spenser at the
court of Arthur; by the Italian romancers, at the court of
Charlemagne. These, of course, are the two main medieval
fields of romance, <i>matière de Bretagne and matière du roi</i>;
and into either of them may enter incidentally the matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
of Troy with the progeny of Aeneas or “Hector’s arms.”
Though the Charlemagne tradition may be somewhat
more distinct with its twelve paladins and its one traitor,
the two are essentially alike in being, for the actual
world out of joint, kingdoms of chivalry. Thither the
Renaissance turned from the Wars of the Roses or the
hired soldiers of Italy. Gunpowder had abolished single
combat; feudalism was gone; chivalry had been reduced
to ceremony. Therefore romance was out of date. No; the
fact that romance survived the Renaissance shows that it
has no date. The romantic <i>therefore</i> is that poetry must
once more revive ideals. Sinister violence in Warwickshire
or Ferrara denies chivalry; romance revives it.</p>

<p>This fundamental motive strikingly unites the two
fifteenth-century soldier romancers Malory and Boiardo.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sir Thomas Malory (1394?-1471) was attached in his
young manhood to the retinue of the great Richard Beauchamp,
Earl of Warwick, widely celebrated as a pattern of
chivalry. After much military service he sat in the Parliament
of 1445. Arraigned in 1451 before a local court at Nuneaton
on the charge of breaking into the abbey of St Mary at
Coombe and robbing it, and further of ambushing the Duke
of Buckingham, he was remanded to the King’s Bench and
imprisoned for most of his last twenty years. In Newgate
Jail he finished his <i>Morte d’Arthur</i> (1469-1470). These few
facts, opening much inference, tell us surely that he was imprisoned
for violence in a time of violence. The chivalry that
he celebrates in the greatest English literary work of a sterile
period has the relief of contrast.</p>

<p>Matteo Maria Boiardo (1434-1494), usually called “the
Count,” was brought up at the brilliant ducal court of Ferrara.
He was sent on embassies, married a Gonzaga, was gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
of honor to Eleonora, and governor (<i>Capitano</i>), first (1480)
of Modena, and then (1487, the year in which he published
the first two books of his <i>Orlando innamorato</i>) of Reggio.
Tradition has him genial and easy-going, and adds picturesquely
that when he found a sonorous name for one of his
Carolingian heroes he volleyed his castle bells.</p>

<p>His writing was abundant, various, characteristic of his
time: ten Latin eclogues and several Latin epigrams; many
Petrarchan sonnets, with <i>canzoni</i> and madrigals; ten Italian
eclogues; <i>capitoli</i> on fear, jealousy, hope, love, and excellence
(<i>virtù</i>); a five-act comedy, <i>Timone</i>, drawn from Lucian;
translations from Herodotus, Xenophon’s <i>Cyropaedia</i>, the
<i>Golden Ass</i> of Apuleius, and the <i>Lives</i> of Cornelius Nepos.</p>

</div>

<p>Different enough in fortune, the two had the same
experience of actual war, and turned from it with the
same literary motive, a wistful and generous desire to
animate the dislocated and groping present with the courage
and devotion of an idealized great past. Poetry of
escape, this is also poetry of faith. It lifts Symphorien
Champier’s clumsy <i>Gestes ensemble la vie du preulx chevalier
Bayard</i> (1525) with the ideal of a knight “sans
peur et sans reproche.” It will seize upon the death of
Sir Philip Sidney as romantic. It will survive the allegorizing
of Spenser. It is the refuge from the industrial
age in Tennyson’s <i>Idylls of the King</i>. If fighting and
politics remain as ugly as in the fifteenth century, Edwin
Arlington Robinson will not be the last poet of romance.</p>

<p>Boiardo makes the contrast very explicit.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>[The robber replied] “What I am doing every great lord
does in your upper world. They make havoc of their enemies
in war for aggrandizement and to cut a bigger figure. A single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
man like me makes trouble for seven, perhaps ten; they rage
against ten thousand. And they do still worse than I in that
they take what they do not need.” [Said Brandimarte] “It is
indeed a sin to take from one’s neighbor as my world does;
but when it is done only for the state, it is not evil; it is at
least pardonable.” [The robber replied] “A man is more
easily pardoned when he frames the charge himself. And I
tell you, and make full confession, that I take what I can
from any one who can less” (II. xix. 40).</p>

<p>O Fame, attendant of emperors, nymph so singing great
deeds in sweet verse that thou bringest men honor even after
death and makest them eternal, where art thou fallen? To
sing ancient loves and tell the battles of giants. For the world
of this thy time cares no longer for fame or for excellence
(II. xxii. 2).</p>

<p>Then with choice rhymes and better verse shall I make combats
and loves all of fire. Not always shall the time be so out
of joint as to drag my mind from its seat. But now my songs
are lost. Of little avail to give them a thought while I feel
Italy so full of woe that I cannot sing, and hardly can I sigh.
To you, light lovers and damsels, who have at heart your
noble loves, are written these fair stories flowering from courtesy
and valor. They are not heard by those fell souls who
make their wars for despite and rage (II. xxxi. 49-50).</p>

</div>

<p>The distinctive difference between the two fifteenth-century
romancers is that Malory translates; Boiardo rewrites.
Malory may contract or expand, adapt or add; but
in general he follows what he calls “the French book.”
Boiardo, finding the Italian versions vulgarized (<i>tra
villani</i>, II. xii. 3), wishes to make the old tradition once
more literary. To restore their dignity, he gives the
paladins more than verse. So romance throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Renaissance, as before and since, both survived and was
changed. It was rehearsed, translated, printed in its medieval
forms; and it was shaped to a distinctive Renaissance
pattern.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_V_2">2. SEPARATE ROMANCES</h3>

<p>What the presses most readily carried on from the
Middle Age was the separate romances that had not been
merged in one of the cycles. The old fairy-mistress story
told by Jean d’Arras as <i>Mélusine</i> (1387) was printed at
Geneva in 1468. <i>Pontus and the Fair Sidoine</i>, translated
into German in 1468, was printed in French at Lyon in
1484 and in German at Augsburg in 1548. <i>Amadis of
Gaul</i> traveled from Brittany to Spain and Portugal and
back to France. The French prose version printed in 1540
and again in 1548,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> typically romantic in love, adventure,
and chivalry, deserved its popularity also by narrative
skill. With some lyric dilation of love and an occasional
allusion to classical mythology, the style is generally
restrained to the narrative purpose. Description, rarely
dilated, is often cleverly inwoven. Dialogue adds not only
liveliness, but some characterization. Though the simple
transitions sound like Malory’s (“Now the author leaves
this and returns to the treatment of the child”), this
shifting is not frequent; often it does not really interrupt;
and generally the composition has distinct narrative sequence.
The knighting of Amadis is not merely a scene in
a series; it is a situation, prepared and pointed as at once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
fulfillment and promise. So the complication of the rings
(Chapter XI) is carried out before our eyes through suspense
to solution.</p>

<p>In such separate romances the Middle Age had advanced
the art of verse narrative. Not only in Chaucer’s
masterpiece <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>, but also in the contemporary
<i>Gawain and the Green Knight</i>, the story is
carried forward in consistent sequence to a distinct issue
of character. The Renaissance, though generally it had
other preoccupations, caught some of this vigor in the
telling of single romances. One of these, loosely related
to the Arthurian cycle without ever being embodied, is of
Giron; and this was put into Italian stanzas by Luigi
Alamanni (1495-1556). An industrious and capable man
of letters,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> who spent much of his life in France, he was
a convinced classicist. His <i>Gyrone il cortese</i> (Paris, 1548;
Venice, 1549), though it was written long after Ariosto
had secured fame by quite other methods, shows that he
felt the obligation of a single story, distinct from a cycle,
to keep narrative sequence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Alamanni’s Dedicatory Epistle, after relating the Arthur
stories to history, and mentioning some dozen of the Arthurian
heroes, expounds tournaments and the quests of errant knights,
and offers his Gyrone, as Caxton offers his Malory, to educate
toward true valor. Confessing that he has not always followed
his source in detail, he promises later “another new
work of poetry ... made in the ancient style and order and
imitating Homer and Vergil.” [This was fulfilled in the last
years of his life by his <i>Avarchide</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>The first five books proceed as follows. After preliminary
adventures, Gyrone goes to his bosom friend Danain at Malahalto.
On news of a tournament they decide to go disguised
in black arms (II). But Danain’s wife languishes for love of
Gyrone and gains permission to go thither also under escort
while the two friends lodge with a hermit. After combats on
the way, they arrive at the tournament as Sagramor is victorious
in the first jousts. The beauty of Danain’s wife arouses
the jealousy of the other ladies and the passion of the Greek
king Laco. His ardor and his threats to seize her are overheard
by Gyrone, who courteously rebukes him in a lecture.</p>

<p>Further description of the combats at the tournament (III)
leads to the final victory of Gyrone and Danain. While Laco
still yearns (IV) toward Danain’s wife, a messenger arrives
to conduct her to a neighboring castle. Laco parts from Meliadus,
as Gyrone from Danain. Thus Laco and Gyrone are left
sighing for the same lady in the same forest. They meet, express
their admiration of each other, and sleep side by side
in the wood.</p>

<p>In the morning Laco routs single-handed the lady’s whole
escort (V). The lady appealing eloquently to his honor in
vain, Gyrone arrives and fells him. While the lady debates
with herself whether to reveal her love, and Gyrone is torn
by the conflict of his own with his loyalty to Danain, they are
irresistibly drawn together. In a flowery mead by a spring
they prepare for love. But Gyrone’s lance falling knocks his
sword into the spring. When he has retrieved it, he reads as
never before its inscription summoning to honor, and turns
it in shame on himself. A peasant supervening betrays their
sad plight to Laco.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus the story is brought definitely to a situation of
character. Obvious as the Renaissance manipulation is in
the space given to love, the handling makes this not
merely lyric interlude, but story motive. Though Alamanni<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
is unwilling, or unable, to carry this through the
28,000 lines of his twenty-four books, though he often
fails to give that salience to critical situations which is
evident here, he nevertheless achieves what the Renaissance
cyclical romances generally ignored, narrative sequence.
All he needed to make his <i>Gyrone</i> shorter,
tighter, more compelling, was firmer control of fourteenth-century
narrative art.</p>

<p>For a classicist Alamanni is remarkably sparing of the
fashionable Renaissance allusions. He does, indeed, use
that paganizing phrase which was satirized by Erasmus.
“In the consecrated temples, devoutly about the sacrifices
in accordance with true example, they listened, adored,
and besought the immortal Father”; when Malory would
say, “They heard their Mass and brake their fast.” But
in spite of many Vergilian similes and of occasional orations
to troops, Alamanni’s classicism is not intrusive.
Apparently he thought it had small place in romance.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_V_3">3. THE ARTHURIAN CYCLE IN MALORY</h3>

<p>Among Renaissance romances presenting a traditional
cycle in medieval form the most distinguished is Malory’s
<i>Morte d’Arthur</i>. Caxton’s preface is a manifesto of romance;
and his table of contents displays most of the
stories that had gradually been brought together by the
Middle Age at the Round Table. Between the “<i>enfances</i>”
of the first book and the last great battle in the west are
Balin and Tristan; that Percival, here called Gareth or
Beaumains, who was reared apart in the wildwood; the
mighty Lancelot, his mistress the Queen, and Elaine who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
died for love of him; the quest of the Grail; the traitor
Modred. They are not composed in a narrative sequence.
Balin, Gareth, Tristan, for instance, remain separate
stories. For there is no real connection in Balin’s glimpse
of an earlier Grail story not used in Malory’s Grail books,
or in Gareth’s coming to Camelot and his knighting by
Lancelot. But there is no confusion. The separate stories
are told straightforwardly; the main persons become
familiar; and the exposure of Guinevere makes a crisis
contributing to the subsequent ruin of the goodly fellowship.
The <i>Morte d’Arthur</i> is not merely a series. But its
distinction is in style. Malory’s prose follows that medieval
habit which may be called pure narrative, the telling
of a story singly for its story values. It was not the only
medieval narrative habit; nor is he the only fifteenth-century
author to follow it; but it stands out both in contrast
to classicism conceived as ornamental dilation and in
his own quiet mastery. Without parade, without pause for
ornament, he maintains a grave simplicity that ranges
from homeliness to eloquence. His rhythm—he has little
other sentence art—lingers or quickens with the action,
and answers the emotion.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_V_4">4. THE CAROLINGIAN CYCLE ON THE STREET</h3>

<p>The other cycle, the Carolingian, was popularized in
Italy by street story-tellers, who seem to have been, on the
piazza before audiences of artisans and shopkeepers, somewhat
like the medieval <i>jongleurs</i> before their successive
groups of pilgrims. Their narrative art can be only
guessed; for it was oral. But the guess is helped by the
persistence, even to the present time, of the Carlomagno
marionettes. The recital animated by these large puppets—for
it is recital, not drama—is of a traditional version
called <i>I paladini di Francia</i>, and goes on day after day by
mere aggregation, and with many tirades.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_V_5">5. PULCI</h3>

<p>Italian literary manipulation of the Carolingian cycle in
verse romances began with Luigi Pulci (1432-1484).
His <i>Morgante maggiore</i> (1481, though largely written
by 1470)<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> is selective. Though it bulks large with more
than 30,000 lines of verse, it does not rehearse the deeds
of the paladins by the serial method of installments. At
the end of Canto 5 two main stories, Orlando’s and
Rinaldo’s, are brought together. At the end of Canto IX,
having meantime moved together, the two arrive, with
the other persons whom they have picked up on the way,
for the relief of Montauban and of Carlomagno at Paris.
There is narrative progress from salience to salience. The
dialogue is lively. Though it does not amount to characterization,
it suffices for speed and for mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Said Rinaldo, “Wilt thou be so obtuse as not to look at that
damsel? Thou wouldst not be acceptable as a lover....” Said
Oliver, “Thou art ever for thy jokes. Yonder is something
more serious than word-play” (IV. 61).</p>

<p>Oliver looked at Rinaldo, hardly able to hold his gaze for
weeping, and said: “’Tis true that man cannot hide love and
coughing. As thou seest, dear brother, love has caught me at
last with his claws. I can no longer hide this desire. I know
not what to do, what to decide. Cursed be the day on which
I saw her. What am I to do? What dost thou advise?” Said
Rinaldo, “Believe me, thou wilt leave this place. Leave the
lady, marquis Oliver. Our intention was not to yearn, but to
find Orlando” (IV. 88-90).</p>

</div>

<p>The naughty machinations of Malagigi are, indeed,
comic interpolations; nothing comes of them; but the
machinations of Gano have narrative function. There is
hardly any separable description. Love laments are
sketched, not dilated. Pulci is interested, and interests us,
in his story as a story. To this end he takes a free hand
with events. We have the usual paynim siege of Paris or
of Montauban, but no attempt to include all the items
of tradition. Pulci takes what he wishes and puts it where
he wishes.</p>

<p>To call the poem a burlesque is misleading. The incidental
farce, as in Boiardo and Ariosto, is rather appeal
to Renaissance fondness for the grotesque as contrast.
Though Pulci may have wished to pierce the inflation of
the Carolingian street tirades, he was too clever to think
of holding parody through 30,000 lines. Reducing the
medieval aggregation to an intelligible story, he also,
with an art more delicate than burlesque, reduced the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
style. Turning from both medieval gravity and Renaissance
luster, he brought romance down to earth. Oliver
falls in love promptly, utterly, and successively. The humor
of this in real life Pulci frankly seeks. When two knights
dare each other, he renders their speech not as oration,
but as homely flyting. He is irreverent in the way of
fashionable conversation. But his main object and achievement,
as it is not parody, so it is not satire. It is pleasant,
often humorous story of familiar antiquated persons in
traditional events and setting, but in daylight.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_V_6">6. BOIARDO</h3>

<p>Boiardo, indignant at the degradation of the Carolingian
heroes among the vulgar—how did he proceed
toward elevation?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Who will give me the voice and the words, and utterance
magnanimous and profound? (I. xxvii. 1).</p>

<p class="noindent">Till now my song has not ventured far from shore. Now I
must enter upon the great deep, to open immeasurable war.
All Africa lies beyond that sea; and all the world flashes with
men in arms (II. xvii. 2).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The poet seems to nerve himself, as Vergil at the opening
of <i>Aeneid</i> VII, for loftier diction. The average Renaissance
poet of the next century would invoke the Muses
for that “high style” which had come down from classical
through medieval rhetoric. But the words of Boiardo’s
invocation are not heightened thus; nor is his diction
generally. He not only omits the Muses here; he is very
sparing with classical allusion throughout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>Book I mentions the Cyclops, Circe, Thyestes, Medusa,
the Centaurs, Vulcan, Atalanta, the dragon’s teeth, and
Hercules; Book II, a faun, the easy descent to Hades, the
god of love, Pasithea, Narcissus, the Laestrigonians and
Anthropophagi, the goddess Fame, Arion, and the Sibyl.
Hector’s arms are brought in as a piece of medieval
derivation from Troy. Classical similes are inserted here
and there, as if conscientiously: the meeting of two winds,
fire in grain, a boar or bear at bay, two bulls or two lions.
Nor does Boiardo strive for other ornament. His heightening
is rather the sheer extravagance of epic brag.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Their blows were heard nearly a mile in the wood (I. iii.
59).</p>

<p>They came with such a battle-cry as made earth tremble,
and sky and sea (I. iv. 51).</p>

<p>The moat brimmed with the blood of the slain (I. xi. 32).</p>

<p>Fire came to his heart and his face, and flamed from his
helmet. He ground his teeth. His knees so clamped Brigliadoro
that the mighty steed sank in the path (I. xv. 19).</p>

<p>The grinding of his teeth could be heard more than a bow-shot
(I. xv. 33).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Otherwise his words are usually as simple as Malory’s. So
far, classicism has made no headway in Renaissance verse
narrative.</p>

<p>Boiardo’s sentences, as Malory’s, are typically aggregative,
sometimes even crude. Instead of tightening a
sentence or a stanza, he remains frankly diffuse. Fluent,
sometimes slack, he runs on as if orally. His verse is
pleasantly varied. Though he hardly ever lets a line end
with a down-beat, he freely begins either up or down, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
shifts to a dactyl. A stanza rarely runs over; but it is often
linked with the next by refrain, as in popular poetry.
Here and there the closing line of his octave sounds like
an experiment in the direction followed later by Spenser.
Inferior in stanza control to Boccaccio and to Ariosto,
diffuse, somewhat careless, he is always agreeably and
sometimes charmingly fluent.</p>

<p>Yet description, which became a regular Renaissance
cue for dilation, Boiardo handles economically. Even
where he is conventional he does not dilate; and usually
he is both distinct and concise.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>That spring was all adorned with white and polished alabaster,
and so richly with gold that it shone in the flowery mead
(I. iii. 33).</p>

<p>A fair rich palace made of marble polished so smooth as to
mirror the whole garden (I. viii. 2).</p>

<p>Secret gardens of fresh verdure are above on the roofs and
hidden on the ground. Gems and gold pattern all these noble
and joyous places. Clear springs unstintingly fresh are surrounded
by shady thickets. Above all, the place has an odor
to give oppressed hearts their joy again (I. viii. 5).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">His stories pictured on walls (<i>depintura istoriata</i>)
whether fresco or mosaic, have a literary source. They
are from the Troy stories pictured on the walls of Dido’s
palace in <i>Aeneid</i> II. Boiardo’s briefer rendering may
have been suggested by the “epigrams” of the Greek
<i>Anthology</i>, or by survivals in southern Italy of such
pictures with verse inscriptions. Certainly his palaces and
gardens often recall the Norman-Arab art of Sicily. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
it is art that he pauses to note oftener than scenery. In all
this his classicism is both discreet and artistic. He does
not borrow; he adapts.</p>

<p>The larger scene, the field of the traditional struggle
of East with West, receives more definite geography.
The haze over medieval Ermonie had been often pierced
by merchant voyagers. Though there are still the Isole
Felice or Lontane, we read now of Aragon and Barcelona,
Granada, Toledo, Seville, Valencia, and Gibraltar; of
Agrigentum and Mongibello as well as of Sicily at large;
of Cyprus, Crete, and Rhodes; of Aigues Mortes, Bordeaux,
Gascony, Languedoc, Perpignan, and Roussillon;
of Damascus, Niniveh, Trebizond, and Tripoli.</p>

<p>The traditional chivalric equality of Saracen knights
with Christian, as in Malory, is emphasized.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>King Charles the Great with genial face had seated himself
among his paladins at the round table. Before him were
also Saracens, who would not use chair nor bench, but lay
like mastiffs on their rugs, scorning the usage of the Franks
(I. i. 12-13).</p>

<p>The paynim king Balugante, divining Rinaldo’s irritation
at some of his fellow Christians, sends him a courteous and
discerning message. Saracen knights are armed, titled, respected
as are Christian, and mingle with them freely. Their
bravery is not merely admitted; Rodomonte is a legendary
demon of force, and Ruggiero in his pagan days is a pattern
of both force and courtesy.</p>

</div>

<p>The traditional echoes of folklore are repeated.
Feraguto’s strength revives when he touches earth. A
child stolen in infancy is recognized. Herbs are gathered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
under a new moon. Ruggiero, as Percival, is brought up
beyond sight of arms. There are waters of forgetfulness,
a loathly lady waiting to be restored by a kiss, a magic
steed, a white hart, a monster adversary transformed,
and a retreat under water.</p>

<p>Grotesque interludes, barely touched by Malory, found
occasionally elsewhere, and quite regular in Italian popular
versions, are not only admitted by Boiardo; they are
dwelt upon with evident relish. Thus Rinaldo fights with
a giant.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Of no avail the furious assault; of no avail the baron’s nimble
skill. He could not reach so high. Suddenly Rinaldo dismounted
and with one bound leapt upon the giant’s croup
when he was not looking. He knocked his helm and his steel
cap to pieces and, redoubling his strokes as if he were hammering
iron at the furnace, he split the great head in two.
Fell the giant with a rush that made the earth shake (I. iv.
64-65).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Orlando leapt even higher, so that again and again he
met his giant face to face—in the air. Angelica threw into
a monster’s mouth a cake that stuck his teeth together, so
that Rinaldo might safely, though with enormous effort,
strangle him. Rodomonte bare-headed at sea hears his
hair rattle with ice. Astolfo is beguiled to board a whale,
and Rinaldo follows, both on horseback.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">On Bayard he plunged into the sea after the great fish in
desperation. That whale went slowly, slowly; for it is very
large and by nature grave (II. xiii. 65).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Marfisa, the woman knight, had her horse stolen and
pursued the thief long in vain. The conception is grotesque;
the execution, pure farce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">A fortnight had she followed him, nor was fed meantime on
aught but leaves. The false thief, who was most astute, sped
his flight with quite different food. For he was so quick and
so bold that every tavern he saw he would enter and fall to
eating, and then flee without paying his shot. And although
the taverners and their waiters were after him with their
pitchers and jugs in their hands, off he was, wiping his mouth
and grinning (II. xv. 68-69).</p>

</div>

<p>Love, announced in the title <i>Orlando innamorato</i> and
frequently asserted, has little more scope in Boiardo than
in Malory. Whether the title expresses an original intention
abandoned, or an appeal to court ladies, or merely a
certain period in the hero’s life, Boiardo’s interest was
elsewhere.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Long time Morgan, Alcina, and their magic wiles have kept
me waiting; nor have I shown you a good sword-stroke (II.
xiv. 1).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The good sword-stroke is what he gives with both
hands, even as Malory.</p>

<p>Since the main interest is single combat, and all the
fighters, even the Saracens, are memorable, there is a
long roll of persons. Of the hundred mentioned in the
first five cantos about a third never reappear; few are
characterized consecutively; none is consecutively in action
for any considerable period. The long poem is frankly a
series, not a sequence. Boiardo’s usual method is to carry
one of his stories to a crisis, leave it to pick up another,
and so on.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Let us now return to Astolfo, who remained, you know,
alone at the fountain (I. ii. 17).<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">As the Carolingian recitals on the piazza, or behind the
marionettes, the <i>Orlando innamorato</i> may be entered at
almost any point. What is there heard or read is interesting
mainly for itself, very little as arising from previous
action and characterization or as preparing for what follows.
To say, then, that it fuses the two cycles is quite
misleading. Boiardo brings in an Arthurian name, Tristan
or Lancelot, as simply as he adds another Carolingian.
He puts Merlin’s well in the forest of Ardenne. He interpolates
Morgan le Fay among the Orlando stories. But
fusion, whether of these Arthurians or of his own Carolingians,
is not in all his thoughts. He is engaged not in
composing the Carolingian story, but in rehearsing the
Carolingian stories.</p>

<p>Boiardo’s <i>Orlando</i>, then, is a collection of heroes fighting
in the struggle between East and West. Within that
frame, as within the frame of Arthur’s Round Table,
tradition had collected many stories. Boiardo finds room
for them, and even for others quite unrelated. Those of
the greatest knights, Orlando, Rinaldo, Oliver, and their
ladies and friends, the obligatory stories, he can tell by
installments because they are familiar and have been already
connected. The others he inserts here and there for
variety. Not only does he accept the medieval cyclical
aggregation, he ignores the later medieval achievement of
narrative sequence in smaller scope through characterization.</p>

<p>A certain Tisbina, who has nothing to do with Charlemagne,
is in much the same dilemma as Chaucer’s
Dorigen in the Franklin’s Tale; and her Iroldo’s response<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
is much the same as that of Dorigen’s Arveragus.
Chaucer’s solution is convincing, in spite of impossible
marvels, because it is motivated by Dorigen’s character.
Boiardo’s solution is inferior because it is quite extraneous
and casual. His Tisbina is not characterized sufficiently
to motivate the story toward any convincing issue.</p>

<p>Much less is Boiardo concerned to motivate his whole
story. His Orlando in love is even removed for long
stretches from the great struggle; and Boiardo interrupts
both the love and the struggle to tell of Tisbina and
Iroldo or insert a <i>fabliau</i>.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> True, his poem remained unfinished;
but evidently he had no idea of making it a
coherent whole. His Latin and Greek did not suggest to
him the shaping of verse narrative. Discernible in his
style, though never intrusive, they do not move his composition;
for composition was not his concern. Ignoring
alike the medieval progress and Pulci’s narrative cleverness
with his own material, he was content with abundant
activity, variety, and fluency.</p>

<p>But in another use of the classics he forecast the Renaissance
habit of encomium. Ruggiero, legendary ancestor
of his Ferrara patrons, brought up in paganism and
remote from deeds of arms, is sought by Agramante for
his great expedition against the Christian West. Ruggiero’s
aged tutor warns Agramante against the ultimate
consequences of taking the marvelous youth into France.
Charlemagne, he says, may be defeated, and our pride
and courage enhanced;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>... but afterward the youth will become Christian, and—ah!
traitress house of Maganza, which heaven should not
tolerate on earth—in the end Ruggiero shall have through
thee his death.</p>

<p>Would that were the final grief! But his descendants shall
remain Christian, and come to honor as great as any the
world knows today. They shall keep all, all generosity, all
courtesy, sweet love and joyous state in a house the flower of
the world.</p>

<p>I see Hugo Alberto di Sansogna descend to the Paduan
plain, expert in arms, in intellect, in all the ways of glory,
generous, noble, and above all humane. Hear, ye Italians: I
warrant you. He who comes with that standard in hand brings
with him all your redemption. Through him shall Italy be
filled with prowess.</p>

<p>I see Azzo I and Aldobrandino III, nor know which to call
the greater; for the one has killed the traitor Anzolino; the
other has broken the Emperor Henry. Behold another Rinaldo
paladin. I say no more of him than Lord of Vicenza, of
Treviso, of Verona, who strikes the crown from Frederick.</p>

<p>Nature shows forth her treasure. Lo! the marquis who
lacks no point of honor. Blest the age, and happy they who
shall live in a world so free! In his time the golden lilies
shall be joined to that white eagle whose home is in heaven;
and his domain shall be the flower of Italy from the one
fair seacoast to the other.</p>

<p>And if the other son of Amphitryon, who there appears in
habit of a duke, has as much mind to seize dominion as he has
to follow good and flee evil, all the birds—not to say the men
who act in this great play—would flock to obey him. But
why should I gaze further into the future? Thou destroyest
Africa, King Agramante (II. xxi. 54-59).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">With reminiscence, perhaps, of Dante, this is obviously
patterned on Vergil. The historical vision of the house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
of Este has its model in the vision of the Augustans.
Encomium with Boiardo is neither so frequent nor so
fulsome as it was to become with Ariosto and with
Spenser. Was that, perhaps, one reason for his double
eclipse? He was first superseded by Ariosto and then
rewritten by Berni.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_V_7">7. ARIOSTO</h3>

<p>The brilliant <i>Orlando furioso</i> (1516) of Ludovico
Ariosto (1474-1533) is one of the most typical verse
narratives of the Renaissance, as it was the most popular.
More accomplished than Boiardo in diction, verse, and
composition, and more responsive to the Renaissance,
Ariosto still follows the same serial plan. The two poets
differ more in degree than in kind. Both were trained in
the classics; both began by writing Latin; both offer
romance as inspiring contrast with actuality.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>O great hearts of those ancient knights! They were rivals;
they differed in religion; they still felt the rude and wicked
strokes aching throughout their bodies; and yet through dark
woods and crooked paths they went together without distrust
(i. 22).</p>

<p>[War has been debased through the diabolical invention of
artillery (xi. 22-25)]. How foundest thou ever place in
human hearts, O invention criminal and ugly! Through thee
military glory has been destroyed, through thee the craft of
arms dishonored, through thee valor and prowess so diminished
that oft the knave seems better than the good soldier.</p>

<p>And though Rinaldo was not very rich in cities or treasure,
he was so affable and genial and so prompt to share with
them whatever he had that not one of his meinie was drawn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
away by offer of more gold. A man of Montauban never forsakes
it unless great need constrains him elsewhere (xxxi. 57).</p>

<p>O famished, deformed, fierce Harpies, who in blinded and
misguided Italy, perhaps as punishment of ancient sins, bring
to every table divine judgment! Innocent children and faithful
mothers drop with hunger while they see one feast of
these foul monsters devour what might have kept them
alive.... [Italy cries] Is there no one of you ... to free your
tables from the filth and the claws ... as the paladin freed that
of the Ethiop king? (xxxvi. 1-3).</p>

</div>

<p>Encomium with Ariosto becomes pervasive. Animated
of course by the personal ends of a court poet, it serves
also the literary end of magnificence, the first aspect in
which the Renaissance viewed epic.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Who will give me the voice and the words fit for a subject so
noble? Who will lend me wings strong enough to attain my
lofty conception? Far greater than its customery heat must
be the poetic furor in my breast. For this part I owe my lord,
since it sings of the noble line from which he sprang.</p>

<p>Among the illustrious lords issued from heaven to govern
the earth, never seest thou, O Phoebus who surveyest the
wide earth, a race more glorious in peace or in war, nor any
whose nobility has been kept longer, and shall be kept, if
that prophetic light which inspires me errs not, so long as
the heavens revolve about the pole (iii. 1-2).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The Vergilian vision of Augustan Rome is heard again
in Merlin’s prophecy. Epic rolls of honor muster the
English warriors, the women of Este, even the painters.
Besides these are many incidental references, especially
at canto openings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Of courtesy, of nobility, examples among the ancient warriors
were many, and few are there among the moderns. But
of impious ways enough was seen and heard in that war,
Hippolito, whose captured standards thou hast used to adorn
our temples, as thou broughtest to thy ancestral shores their
captive galleys laden with prey (xxxvi. 2).</p>

</div>

<p>The mission of the poet to confer fame, proclaimed
by Ariosto and repeated by Ronsard, is also seen in bitter
contrast. The speaker is St John the Evangelist.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>So worthy men are snatched from oblivion worse than
death by poets. O intelligent and wise princes who follow
the example of Augustus in making writers your friends, and
thus need not fear the waves of Lethe. Poets, as singing
swans, are rare, poets not unworthy of the name; for heaven
prevents too great abundance of famous ones by the great
fault of stingy lords, who by oppressing excellence and exalting
vice banish the noble arts. We may suppose that God has
deprived these ignorant men of their wits and darkens their
light of reason in making them shy of poetry, that death may
quite consume them. For wicked as their ways might be, if
only they knew how to win the friendship of Apollo they
might rise from their graves in sweeter odor than nard or
myrrh.</p>

<p>Aeneas was not so pious, nor Achilles so mighty, as their
fame, nor Hector so brave. There have been thousands and
thousands who might with truth have been put before them;
but the palaces or great villas bestowed by their descendants
have given them sublime honors without end at the honored
hands of writers. Augustus was neither so holy nor so benign
as sounds the trumpet of Vergil; but his having good taste
in poetry brings him pardon for his unjust proscription. Nor
would he who had against him earth and hell have the less
fame, perhaps, if he knew how to keep the writers his friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>Homer made Agamemnon victorious, the Trojans cowardly
and dull, and Penelope constant to her husband through the
thousand persecutions of the suitors. If you wish to uncover
the truth, convert the story to its contrary; that the Greeks
were routed, Troy the victor, and Penelope a harlot. On the
other hand hear how fame leaves Dido, whose heart was so
chaste, to be reputed a baggage, only because Vergil was not
her friend. Wonder not that I am oppressed thereat, and
that I speak of it at such length. I love writers and pay them
what I owe; for in your world I too was a writer (xxxv.
22-28).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This strange parenthesis of satire, dubious in its humor,
shocking in its irreverence, sounds today like encomium
reduced to advertisement. It sounds also like the bitter
retort of realism to that fiction of the courtier which was
to have literary vogue through Castiglione. Bitter and
foul the actual wars of Italy in contrast to old chivalry;
but bitter also the trade of those who sing them.</p>

<p>Though often oratorical, Ariosto rarely seeks his magnificence
by elaboration of style. He has too much taste,
too much concern for popular appeal. He even admits the
appeal of the traditional epic brag. Rodomonte alone sacks
a city; Grifone throws a knight over the wall; great rocks
are hurled from ships; and—triumph of rodomontade—the
fragments of a combat fly up to the sphere of fire and
come down lighted.</p>

<p>There are a few reminiscences of the <i>Aeneid</i>, fewer of
Horace, fewest of Dante and Petrarch. Classical allusion
has become a common decoration. Aurora is already
obligatory for dawn. Occasionally a classical periphrasis
(“Hardly had the Licaonian seed turned her plow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
through the furrows of heaven” xx. 82) is obscure; or
there is incongruity in combining Avernus and the Sibyl
with Merlin’s grotto, or the Fates with Death, Nature,
and St John. But allusion is neither paraded nor often
intruded. Classical similes, much more frequent than with
Boiardo, are evidently sought for decoration. They are
one of the signs that Ariosto’s time thought of epic in
terms of style. But they are used also for vividness; and
they range widely. Besides those drawn conventionally
from beasts of prey or from storm, there are many quite
sharply individual: wood steaming in a fire, grass ebbing
and flowing in the wind, a pile-driver, and a mine cave-in.
Ariosto’s decoration is rarely a hindrance, rarely even
elaborate. He is easy to read. The bearing of a passage
here and there may be dubious because of looseness in
the narrative, but never its meaning. He has reconciled
dignity with popularity. Instead of posing as literary, he
makes his readers feel literary themselves. He puts them
at ease in fine company.</p>

<p>In sentence and stanza movement Ariosto has made his
poem easy to read by diffuse and various fluency. Writing
for entertainment, he uses balance or other word-play
only as occasional means of variety. He is neither sententious
nor pretentious. His metrical skill, remarkable in
range and control, is not put forward for exhibition; it
is an accompaniment so flexible to mood as constantly
to enhance the connotation. Rarely lengthening the final
line of the stanza often using refrain to link stanzas, and
sometimes within stanzas, he is most characteristic in
making the <i>ottava rima</i> run on not only from line to line,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
but from stanza to stanza. This fluent ease is by no means
impromptu spontaneity. It is the work of ten years. His
diffuseness, then, is not carelessness; it is adjustment alike
to the immediate audience of the court and to the increasing
readers of the press.</p>

<p>Especially significant, therefore, is his handling of
description. His landscape is often both brief and conventional.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Winsome thickets of pleasant laurel, of palms and gayest
myrtle, of cedar, of orange with fruit and flowers woven in
forms most various and all beautiful, make a refuge from the
fervid heat of summer days with their thick parasols; and
among these branches in safe flight nightingales go singing.</p>

<p>Among the purpled roses and the white lilies, which the
warm air keeps ever fresh, rabbits and hares are seen at peace,
and deer, heads high and proud, without fear that any one
may kill or take them, feed or chew their cud at rest. Swift
and nimble leap the harts and goats that abound in those
country places (vi. 21-2).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">But he has a way of animating convention with a sharp
word of his own.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">When the trembling brooks (<i>trepidi ruscelli</i>) began to loosen
the cold ice in their warm waves (xii. 72).</p>

</div>

<p>Architecture and decoration often remain generalized,
or offer few details. Ampler is pageantry.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>With triumphal pomp and great festivity they return together
into the city, which is green with branches and garlands.
All the streets are hung with tapestries. A shower of herbs
and flowers spreads from above and falls upon and around
the victors, cast in handfuls from loggias and fair windows
by ladies and damsels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>In various places where they turn a corner they find improvised
arches and trophies displaying pictures of the ruins
and fires of Biserta and other worthy deeds; elsewhere,
balconies with divers games and spectacles and mimes and
plays; and at every corner is inscribed the true title: To the
Liberators of the Empire.</p>

<p>With sound of shrill trumpets and mellow clarinets, with
harmony of every instrument, mid laughter and applause, joy
and favor of the people, who could hardly come close enough,
the great Emperor dismounted at the palace, where several
days that company stayed to enjoy itself with tournaments,
<i>personnages</i> and farces, dances and banquets (xliv. 32-34).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This is a preciously distinct picture of actual Renaissance
pageantry. More vividly detailed is the funeral of Brandimarte.
Even these, however, are not dilated. They are
appropriate to their narrative function. The long descriptive
summary of Astolfo’s journey through the Valley of
the Moon is an interlude of satire; and Orlando’s battle
with the monster Orc is pure grotesque. He rows into the
Orc’s mouth, casts anchor there, and, when the monster
plunges, tows him ashore. Moreover, both these are
narrated; neither is a descriptive pause.</p>

<p>Ariosto does pause, however, to dilate description of
the beauty of women. Seven stanzas enumerate the charms
of the enchantress Alcina (vii. 10-16).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The fair palace excelled not so much in surpassing the
richness of every other as in having the most delightful folk
in the world and the noblest. Little did one differ from another
in flowered age and in beauty; only Alcina was most
beautiful of all, as the sun is more beautiful than any star.</p>

<p>In person she was as well formed as the industry of painters
can imagine: her blond hair long and tressed; gold is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
more splendid and lustrous. Rose mingled with hawthorn
white spread over her delicate cheek. Of polished ivory was
her joyous forehead, and of just proportion.</p>

<p>Beneath two black and fine-spun brows are two black eyes,
as two clear suns, sympathetic in gaze, frugal in movement,
about which Love seems to sport and fly, and from which he
empties his quiver and visibly steals hearts. Thence descends
a nose in which Envy herself could find no fault.</p>

<p>Beneath this, as between two valleys, the mouth besprent
with native cinnabar, wherein are two rows of choice pearls,
enclosed or opened by fair, sweet lips, whence issues speech
of courtesy fit to soften even a base heart, and whence rises
the winsome laughter that brings paradise to its place on
earth [and so on for three more stanzas].</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This is the conventional description called by the Middle
Age <i>blason</i>. It is used again for Olimpia bound to the
rock, where the situation itself is conventional. A bit of
very old folklore, and coming down also through classical
mythology as Perseus and Andromeda, it was a commonplace
for dilation.</p>

<p>But what Ariosto dilates oftenest is emotion. His characteristic
pauses are lyric. Thus he interpolates the medieval
<i>compleint d’amour</i> not only again and again, but
for long exhalations. Bradamante alone utters a whole
series of these laments. The second begins as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Then shall it be true (said she) that I must seek him who
flees me and hides? Then must I prize him who scorns me?
Must I implore him who never answers me? Shall I endure
to hold at heart him who hates me, who thinks his qualities
so rare that an immortal goddess must descend from heaven
to kindle his heart with love?</p>

<p>In his pride he knows that I love him, that I adore him;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
nor will he of me for lover nor for slave. In his cruelty he
knows that I yearn and die for him; and he waits till after
death to give me help. And lest I tell him of my martyrdom,
fit to move even his stubborn will, he hides himself from me,
as the asp who to keep her venom refuses to hear the charm.</p>

<p>Ah! Love, stay him who hastes so free beyond my slow
running, or restore me to the state whence thou hast taken
me, when I was subject neither to thee nor to any other.
Alas! how deceitful and foolish is my hope that ever prayers
should move thee to pity! For thou delightest to draw
streams of tears from our eyes; nay, thereon thou feedest and
livest (xxxii. 18-20).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Substantially the same is the famous madness of Orlando.
Though Ariosto cleverly gives it narrative enough to relieve
its prolongation through twenty-five stanzas, it is a
dilated lyric interlude.</p>

<p>The art that dilates these lyrics is rhetoric. Thus they
answer not only the learning, but the taste of the Renaissance.
With Alcina’s charms and Olimpia’s, they were the
favorite passages of the Pléiade. Ronsard, using them
often, was especially fond of Orlando’s madness. Beyond
the Pléiade, they open a long vista toward Italian opera.
To look the other way, back to the Middle Age, is to meet
the sharp contradiction of Dante. Paolo and Francesca,
or Ugolino, is the poetic antithesis to Bradamante and
Orlando.</p>

<p>Such dilated interludes would interrupt any progress
of the whole story; and they are not the only interpolations.
Traditionally the cyclical romances might pause to
add incidental stories, usually told by errant damsels
seeking help. Ariosto inserts these freely, and quite as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
freely others having even less relevance. The story of
Ginevra, Ariodante, and Polinesso (Canto V), for instance,
though it falls among Rinaldo’s adventures, has
its own intrigue and motivation. Equally separable, the
<i>fabliau</i> of Fiammetta is told for sex, and prolonged by
appended dialogue and comment. “Ladies,” it begins,
“and you who hold ladies in esteem, for heaven’s sake
give no ear to this story.... Omit this canto; for my story
needs it not and will be no less clear without it.” Evidently
Ariosto has not planned his cantos as chapters.</p>

<p>A mere glance through the summaries prefixed to each
canto will show that the many interruptions are not breaks
in the sequence of the whole. There is no such sequence.
The poem is a collection of parallel stories taken up in
turn, and only thus combined, not integrated in a single
scheme. Accepting Boiardo’s method, he uses the same
frank transitions.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>But to another time I will defer the story of what ensued
from this. I must return to the good King Charles, against
whom Rodomonte was coming in haste and whose folk he
was killing (xviii. 8).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">He even turns them to humor.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I am reminded that I ought to tell you (I promised to, and
then I forgot) of a suspicion that the fair lady of the grieving
Ruggiero had concerning the other lady less pleasing and
more wicked and of sharper and more venomous tooth, so
that through what she heard from Ricciardetto it devoured
the heart in her breast.</p>

<p>I should have told you, and I began something else because
Rinaldo intervened; and then Guidone gave me enough to do,
so that he held me off a bit on the way. From one thing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
another I became so involved that I hardly remembered
Bradamante. I remember her now, and I am going to go on
with her story before I tell of Rinaldo and Gradasso.</p>

<p>Before I speak of her, need is that I speak a bit of Agramante
(xxxii. 1-3).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Such narrative art as Ariosto exhibits is in detail, not in
the onwardness of the whole story. The close is both
interrupted and delayed.</p>

<p>Canto XXXVI, which finally brings Ruggiero and
Bradamante together, ends without their actual reunion.
There is no meeting, no dialogue. Canto XXXVIII takes
Ruggiero from her, to support his honor; “and that,
ladies, is strange.” Canto XLIV still postpones, as lesser
issues have been postponed, <i>the</i> issue, their marriage.
Canto XLVI ends characteristically on description of the
wedding and encomium of Ariosto’s patron Ippolito; but
that the poem may conclude as the <i>Aeneid</i> with the defeat
of Turnus, it gives Ruggiero one more victory. Boccaccio’s
art of the long narrative poem, to say nothing of
Chaucer’s, is ignored.</p>

<p>This is not careless; it is intentional. Some of the delay
at the close was added in the final revision of 1532.
Ariosto designed not sequence, but abundance and variety.
His opening <i>Arma virumque cano</i> is: “I sing the ladies,
the loves, the courtesies, the bold emprise of the time
when the Moors crossed the sea from Africa and did such
harm in France.... Of Orlando too will I tell, how for
love he went mad.” These loves, traditional in still subscribing
to <i>amour courtois</i>, are more various than
Boiardo’s. But though much of the appeal is by amorous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
descant, the staple of this Carolingian romance is still
single combat. As for Orlando’s love madness, announced
in the title and in the opening lines, it is not reached till
Canto XXIII; and once his fury is spent, he disappears
once more for some six cantos. He is hardly even a leading
character. The principal role, for encomium of the house
of Este, belongs to Ruggiero. Stories of the other paladins
are often brought into connection, sometimes skillfully,
sometimes ingeniously, rarely to the extent of making a
situation, never in such an onward scheme as Chaucer’s
<i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>. For that demands what Ariosto
never sought, consistent motivation by progressive characterization
from scene to scene. Such characterization as
Ariosto offers remains separate. Zerbino has more space
than is warranted by any distinct function. Oliver, coming
in casually, is less a person than a great traditional name.
Astolfo’s miraculous journey, with its interesting geographical
list has so little visible function that it might as
well have been made somewhere else, or by some one else.
Leone, one of the most distinct characterizations, comes in
only toward the end. Even Ruggiero meets Bradamante
when he least expects or deserves her.</p>

<p>Ariosto is a typical example of the popular poet
gauging and answering his public. His elegant ease is
flattering. His decoration is distinct. His diffuseness relieves
us of all coöperative thinking. A scene is dilated
through every phase of its emotion, and then discharged
as finished in and for itself. The next will be pleasantly
different, or, if unpleasantly, may be skipped. The dilation,
the variety, that Vergil turned his back upon, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
after him Tasso, Ariosto frankly sought. He has no care
for poetic sequence beyond neat transitions, no poetic
austerity of sustained single purpose. Renaissance poets,
for all the cult of classicism, often revived the ancient
world in Alexandrian decadence, saw in Vergil only his
high style, conceived poetic as rhetoric, and ran after the
“Greek Romances.” Ariosto was one of these Alexandrians.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_V_8">8. TASSO AND SPENSER</h3>

<p>The contrast between Tasso and Spenser is heightened
by the fact that they were closely contemporary. Spenser’s
birth was eight years after Tasso’s; his death, but three
years. Tasso began his <i>Gerusalemme liberata</i> in his twenties,
published it at thirty-one, kept it on his mind
throughout his working life, and finally rewrote it.
Spenser published three books of his <i>Faerie Queene</i> at
thirty-eight, three more at forty-three, and left it unfinished.
Tasso’s is the shortest of the Renaissance verse
romances; Spenser’s was to be the longest. Tasso turned
away from Ariosto toward Vergil; Spenser moved even
farther than Ariosto from epic sequence. Allegory, hardly
more than a figure of speech with Tasso, is announced
by Spenser as his plan. Religion having more place in
these two romances than in any of the others, Tasso’s is
conceived as uniting western Europe, Spenser’s as nationalistic.
Tasso’s poem is one of the greater European books,
and has been widely read in England; Spenser’s great
reputation has been very slow to cross the Channel. The
latter years of the sixteenth century, then, carried on verse
romance in two distinct directions: the classical direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
from Aristotelian theory and Vergilian practice toward
narrative singleness and sequence; the allegorizing of the
medieval cycles toward a series of counsels for individual
and social conduct.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_V_8a">(<i>a</i>) <i>Tasso</i></h4>

<p>Tasso’s is the only one of the Renaissance romances of
chivalry whose title is its subject. Malory’s subject is far
more than the death of Arthur, Pulci’s than Morgante.
Boiardo’s subject is not Orlando in love, nor Ariosto’s
Orlando mad for love. Spenser’s title merely makes his
encomium part of his allegory. But Tasso’s <i>Jerusalem
Delivered</i> exactly sums up his scope and his theme. The
Carolingian tradition, still furnishing the scene and the
persons, no longer furnishes the pattern. The persons
are fewer; and they are recreated to function in a continuous
story. Thus Soliman and Peter the Hermit have
definite roles; and Godfrey becomes the protagonist. The
time is idealized to assemble the heroic past about the
medieval enterprise of deliverance, to bring into one
sequence the <i>chansons de geste</i>, the Carolingian cycle of
romance, and several crusades. The struggle of the West
with the East, no longer background or setting, is brought
forward. It appears much less as the exploits of individuals,
much more as an enterprise in common. Further
it is an enterprise of religion, to rescue the holy places
from unbelievers, to restore them to Christendom as a
shrine of pilgrimage. It is animated by <i>pietas</i>, the Vergilian
motive Christianized, the sense of mission. The
individual warriors, no longer adventurers, are soldiers of
the Cross. Though the actual crusades were medieval,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
they were still in men’s minds as unfinished. Boiardo
laments the postponement of a recent proposal to revive
them. Tasso writes not to further this, or any other present
movement, but to present crusade as historic. He focuses
all crusades in one historic action. His narrative of
Godfrey and the paladins is controlled by the idea of
crusade as deliverance.</p>

<p>Such singleness of purpose naturally reduces encomium.
The expected rolls of honor celebrating the house of
Este, are fewer and more detached.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Reduced also, with
one important exception, are lyric interludes. Turning
conventional themes to beauty, Tasso pauses less often
to dilate emotion with Ariosto than to interpose reflection
or the escape of pastoral.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Scenery, handled with the usual Italian restraint, is
often woven expertly into the narrative. We are made to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
feel Jerusalem before it is described; and the grave and
restrained description of the great Mass is inseparable
from the action. Tasso’s subordination of literary means
to literary function dominates his style. The frequency of
his classical similes is apparent only on review; it does not
challenge attention, much less interrupt. His classical
allusions are not extraneous decoration, much less parade.
His word-play is used oftenest to mark the close of a
stanza. His verse is harmonized. These are various aspects
of artistic conscience. Tasso never plays the virtuoso; he is
too great an artist.</p>

<p>The onwardness of the whole story, which is most
distinctive in this achievement, could hardly be carried
out in Tasso’s time with entire consistency. Though there
is none of the former easy shifting from tale to tale, though
tactics and strategy are made to control and subordinate
the traditional single combats, there are a few interpolated
tales: Sofronia and Olindo in Canto II; Sven, isolated
and picturesque in Canto VIII; Clorinda’s origin in
Canto XII. Canto X is less a stage than a pause to tell
what was said and thought on one side and on the other.
The enchantment of the wood in Canto XIII is a parenthesis
in the siege. The most serious deviation is for
Rinaldo and Armida. Armida has too much stage—as
Dido has in the <i>Aeneid</i>, yes, but with less warrant. While
the siege waits, Cantos XIV and XV detail the infatuation
of Rinaldo and linger over the journey for his recall.
Nothing of this counts for the sequence of the poem but
his defection at a critical point and his return. The rest
is dilated for its own picturesqueness and passion. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
the flaw is conspicuous only because Tasso’s sequence is
beyond any previous attempt. The Rinaldo episode could
be added without disturbance, here or there, in Boiardo’s
poem, Ariosto’s, or Spenser’s. Tasso has taught us to expect
more.</p>

<p>To a degree hitherto unattained in the romances, and
rarely even attempted, his persons are characterized for
their function. Even Armida thus functions early (Canto
V) in the whole scheme as disintegrating. She is more
than a type of enchantress, more than a personification
of lust. Though toward the end her despair at losing
Rinaldo may be too oratorical and too much like Dido’s,
her revenge breaks down for love. In other cases, too,
magic and demons are more acceptable because the visible
human motives and action reduce them almost to figures
of speech. For instance, the magic borrowed from the
<i>Aeneid</i> in Canto X is merely a device for having Soliman
present, acting in his own fate. Personifications are rare;
and even the stock hermit has more distinct function.
Godfrey is much more than Arthur or Charlemagne. His
largeness of view is at once intelligence and faith. A
cardinal example of Tasso’s art is the creative use of the
archangel St Michael. He comes as light and allies the
heavenly host to the earthly. <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i> is not
only the integration of the traditional hero stories; it is
also the realization of the Renaissance dream of epic.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_V_8b">(<i>b</i>) <i>Spenser</i></h4>

<p>Spenser’s most obvious peculiarity of style is archaism.
Some of the <i>arts poétiques</i> repeat perfunctorily the rhetorical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
advice to revive old words; but none of the other
romancers follows it with conviction. Though archaism
is historically one of the habits of sophistic oratory, with
Spenser it was animated rather by the desire to revive the
English poetic tradition. Failing in this through ignorance
of language, he but made his diction more difficult.</p>

<p>The style of the <i>Faerie Queene</i> is of its time in
decorative classical similes. In classical allusions Spenser
leans more heavily on legend and mythology. Sometimes
he inserts lore gratuitously. Throughout he throws together
classical and medieval, Christian, and pagan.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Occasionally mythology is made a vehicle for contemporary
politics and religion. Usually decorative, his mythology
is generally incidental, not functional. Thus his
angels, too, are disappointing beside Tasso’s.</p>

<p>Following thus generally the Renaissance habit of
learned elegance, Spenser shows his own hand in concreteness.
He is less often content with mere epithet. He
specifies even the details of a kitchen; and he specifies
habitually in abundant sensory images, even of ugliness.</p>

<p class="noindent">Spenser’s metric, often obscured by fanciful spelling or
uncertain pronunciation, is expertly varied. The Spenserian
stanza, undoubtedly skillful, is nevertheless inferior
to the Italian octave for narrative. It carries on with
less ease. The sheer metrical task of the six completed
books (3,732 stanzas, or 33,588 lines) was beyond
Spenser’s revision. Some rhymes remain forced by stilted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
transposition, or upon insignificant words, as in the last
line of the first example above, and in:</p>

<p class="noindent">Though he uses expertly the variation of throwing together
two stresses, he has also left many lines clogged

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In both style and verse the <i>Faerie Queene</i> is the least
facile of the chivalric romances.</p>

<p>For the composition of the whole, Spenser’s scheme is
not narrative. The most descriptive of all the romancers,
he has made his total effect not merely abundant separable
ecphrasis but pageantry. For holding the pageantry together
he proposes in his preface moral allegory, “fashioning
a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and
gentle discipline.” This end, Caxton’s preface to Malory
proclaims, is attained without allegory, by the romances
themselves as stories. But now romance, having been first
rewritten in Renaissance style, and then recomposed as
Vergilian epic, is to be moralized. Further, the allegory
is political. Artegall is Lord Grey de Wilton; Duessa
and Radegund, Mary Queen of Scots; Archimago, the
Pope. The poem is anti-Catholic with the Elizabethan
political bias. Its attacks on abuses of the Church, no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
louder than those of <i>Piers Plowman</i>, are essentially different
in that Elizabethan England has broken with the
medieval vision of unity. Spenser speaks for the most
self-sufficient of the rising nations, and makes its national
mission his own. For the divine mission of the poet in
Renaissance classical phrase means practically the claim
of the poet to support by the court. The new nationalism
but intensifies encomium. Spenser was a court poet in
the same way as Ariosto, and to an even greater degree.
He celebrates not only England, but the Queen and his
immediate patrons. He prefixes a letter to Raleigh and
seventeen poems to lords and ladies; and he interposes
the usual references and allusions. None of the chivalric
romances is more devoted to encomium than the <i>Faerie
Queene</i>.</p>

<p>To weave all these strands into any large single sequence
is probably beyond the capacity of allegory, and
certainly beyond Spenser’s achievement. The legendary
history of Britain in Book II has little enough to do with
the theme of constancy; the long pastoral in Book VI
with the theme of courtesy. Even single books, then, do
not always hold together. Within a single virtue we have
at most a medieval series of <i>exempla</i>. Even if Spenser
had lived to subsume all his virtues in Magnificence, the
Renaissance <i>virtù</i>, he would have achieved only the summary
of a series. The earlier critics of the <i>Faerie Queene</i>
were embarrassed by their obligation to consider it as
epic. Spenser’s quoting of the Horatian <i>in mediis rebus</i>
“A poet thrusteth into the middest” in his preface, and
his beginning thus “A gentle knight was pricking on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
plaine” are merely superficial. No long poem is farther
removed from epic than the <i>Faerie Queene</i>. Dryden, in
a digression of his <i>Essay on Satire</i> (1693), said more
significantly: “There is no uniformity of design in
Spenser.”</p>

<p>Instead of being ruled out as merely Dryden’s preoccupation
with French seventeenth-century “regularity,”
this may well be pondered. Later criticism of the romantic
period, indeed, was inclined to reply: “What of it? The
<i>Faerie Queene</i> offers so much else that we are content to
dispense with uniformity of design.” But still later criticism
has not been so sure; and, what is more important,
many readers have balked. The poem does not carry
through. Today those who have read the six books are
inclined to boast. Doubtless the forming of a gentleman
has less appeal as an idea than Tasso’s common enterprise
of deliverance. Certainly the poetic machinery of knight
errantry allegorized as the triumphs of virtues over vices
has less appeal than crusade. Motive and method are
insufficient to integrate the <i>Faerie Queene</i> and carry it
forward. Its very timeliness has faded into insularity.
<i>Don Quixote</i>, full of seventeenth-century Spain, is significant
to the whole western world; the <i>Faerie Queene</i> is
sometimes significant only in terms of Tudor politics. But
probably the main reason for the waning of the <i>Faerie
Queene</i> is the insufficiency of the conception to animate
a long poem and of the composition to carry it forward.
Beside <i>Paradise Lost</i>, to say nothing of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>,
it is seen to have “no uniformity of design” in the
sense of lacking effective integration.</p>

<span class="smaller">DRAMA</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Revival of drama is not a Renaissance achievement.
The Renaissance has no drama distinctively its own.
Even the sixteenth century prolonged a period of transition.
Elizabethan comedy found new ways only in its
last decade; Elizabethan tragedy, French tragedy and
tragicomedy, matured in the seventeenth century. Medieval
sacred plays continued, and the moralities proved
too feeble dramatically to survive. Court shows of various
kinds and degrees did, indeed, experiment dramatically
with mythology, pastoral, and even rustic realism; but
quite generally they lingered in allegory and pageantry,
and their dramatic successes did not widen dramaturgy
till 1590. While it practiced popular drama in <i>mystère</i>
and <i>miracle</i>, the Middle Age had repeated that definition
of drama which made it not so much a distinct form of
composition as a style. This conception persisted through
the Renaissance, especially in tragedy. Tragedy was still
the fall of a prince; and it was rather a dialogue in high
style than a sequence of action on the stage. Renaissance
tragedy was classicized, indeed, in style; but in composition
it remained as immune to the example of the
Greek tragedians as the poetics<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> to the theory of Aristotle.
It still imitated Seneca and quoted the “Ars poetica” of
Horace. Often it was not even intended for the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>Comedy had better auspices and somewhat earlier development.
Plautus and Terence, already familiar to the
Middle Age, had the great advantage of being acted.
Latin school plays, translations, imitations, kept before
the Renaissance the pattern of Latin Comedy. Narrow
and conventional, but definite and stirring, this had been
found adaptable to the <i>fabliau</i> situations of medieval
farce, and was still active. Indeed, it was the starting point
of many a Renaissance dramatist. Until Greek tragedy
finally became active in dramaturgy, the only classical
model for play composition that went beyond Seneca was
Latin Comedy.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VI_1">1. SACRED PLAYS</h3>

<p>The most widespread stage drama of the fifteenth
century was medieval. <i>Mystère</i> and <i>miracle</i>, <i>sacre rappresentazioni</i>,
continued, indeed, well into the sixteenth
century. The <i>Annales d’Aquitaine</i> of Jean Bouchet is quite
specific.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The King of France, by his letters patent issued the 18th day
of January, 1533, commanded all the nobles of Poitou ...
to appear with such [troops and equipment] as they owed for
his service in the following May; and the review (<i>monstres</i>)
was before the Seneschal of Poitou in the city of Poitiers....
On the 14th of July the mayor, échevins, and bourgeois of
Poitiers also gave their review for the king’s service in the
aforesaid city. And on the morrow were made joyous and
triumphal presentations (<i>monstres</i>) of the mysteries of the
Incarnation, Nativity, Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension of
our Savior Jesus Christ, and of the mission given by the Holy
Spirit, which mysteries were played for a fortnight in the old
market of the aforesaid city, in a theater built most triumphally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
around it (<i>en un théatre fait en rond, fort triomphant</i>). And
the aforesaid play began on Sunday, the 19th day of the aforesaid
month, and lasted continuously for the eleven days following,
wherein were very good actors and richly costumed....
The Passion and Resurrection were played also three weeks
afterward, or thereabouts, in the city of Saumur, where I saw
excellent acting (page 473 of the edition of 1644).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This description applies in essentials to the English
Corpus Christi cycles, which we have in fifteenth-century
texts, and to the general European tradition. What was
that tradition in terms of drama? Typically a saint’s
legend (<i>miracle</i>) is less available for a play than a Bible
story. The external life of a saint represented as a series
of trials may be unwieldy or monotonous. The great
moments of the Magdalen, indeed, have as clear stage
possibilities as the sacrifice of Isaac; but generically the
<i>miracles</i> yielded less effective drama than the <i>mystères</i>.
The distinction between the two soon ceased to be current
in England; there the word <i>miracle</i> came to be applied
to either. <i>Mystère</i>, applied as above to Incarnation, Nativity,
Passion, and so forth, refers more properly to a
series than to a single play. Was there drama, then, in a
whole series of sacred plays?</p>

<p>Yes, abstractly in idea, as when we speak of the drama
of the Terror in France. But the dramatic values of a
whole period can be only suggested; they are rather pervasive
than controlling. The suggestion was heightened
for the medieval audience by familiarity with the habit of
conceiving the Old Testament as a prefiguration of the
New and by typical characterization. In sculpture, glass,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
or poetry the Baptist is not only the immediate forerunner;
he is the last of the prophets. The burning bush
is not only a portent for Moses; it prefigures the Virgin
kindled but intact. Piers Plowman, besides being a particular
person in a poem, is typically the <i>bon laboureur</i>;
and on the higher plane he is the Good Shepherd. The
medieval audience, alive to such suggestions, more readily
saw in a given play the larger drama behind the particular
action, felt the communal emotion, and took the typical
experience to itself.</p>

<p>The series as a whole, however, sacred history presented
as a scheme of divine providence, offered no specific
training to a playwright. Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac
should suggest the great sacrifice; but that would not make
it a play. The immediate task was the realization of the
immediate dramatic values: Isaac’s growing fear, Abraham’s
cumulative struggle. Though the series included
items intractable to representation, it offered many situations
worthy of the highest skill. These the medieval
dramatists had abundant practice in handling as distinct
plays. The unknown authors show real dramatic experience
and sometimes clear dramatic achievement. The
English evidence is especially convincing. The guild, of
course, keeping the scrip of a given play along with the
costumes and properties, was free to revise or even to
supersede. Some of the devices, such as the comic struggle
with Noah’s wife, evidently arose from the actual performance.
None the less certain plays stand out as dramatically
composed: the admirable progress of the Brome
<i>Abraham and Isaac</i>, the diction of both Mary and Joseph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
so purely answering the action of the York <i>Nativity</i>, the
rapid, direct, free handling of the Towneley <i>Secunda
Pastorum</i>. The sacred plays, then, constituted within
limits an important dramatic tradition; and that tradition
was still active in the sixteenth century.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VI_2">2. TRAGEDY</h3>

<p>The tragedies of Seneca are so oratorical as to suggest
rather declamation than acting.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The great persons of
Greek tragedy, Oedipus, Medea, or the house of Atreus,
are revived not to interact toward their doom, but to
make speeches. Nevertheless the vogue of pieces so inferior
as drama, holding over from the Middle Age, had
long and wide Renaissance authority. There is no clearer
example alike of the preoccupation with oratory and of
the habit of conceiving poetic as rhetoric. The printing
of the great Greek plays, and even their translation, were
slow in counteracting Seneca. Nor was Seneca altogether
a hindrance. Encouraging the fustian or dullness of lesser
men, he invited the magnificence of Marlowe. But he
delayed the progress of dramaturgy by confirming the
Renaissance neglect of composition for style.</p>

<p>“There is no one in France,” says Turnebus in a note<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
to his friend’s tragedies, “with any pretensions to the
humanities but knows George Buchanan.” The humanists,
lest after all their eminence in Latin should not be ratified
by posterity, prudently praised one another. Joseph
Scaliger called Buchanan the first Latin poet of Europe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
(<i>ommes post se relinquens in Latina poesi</i>), as Heinsius
was to call Joseph Scaliger the greatest scholar and man of
letters. The complacent certitudes have suffered so much
from the irony of time that we should be careful to give
the sixteenth-century humanists their due. The type of
international scholar for whom Latin was the literary
language persisted in Buchanan (1506-1582). Spending
some thirty years in France, he may have been more
familiar with French than with his northern vernacular;
but all his writing was in Latin. Such a humanist might
well sustain his rank in Latin poetry not only by lyric
verse and didactic, but also by dramatic (<i>Georgii
Buchanani Scoti ... opera omnia</i>, ed. Ruddiman, Edinburgh,
1715; Vol. II, “Poemata,” dated 1714), and is
quite typical of Renaissance tragedy in Latin.</p>

<p>His Latin translation of the <i>Medea</i> of Euripides seems
to have been presented by students at Bordeaux in 1543.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
His <i>Jephthes</i>, printed at Paris in 1554, recalls the passage
of the Red Sea classically.</p>

<p class="noindent">Classicism is even certified by pagan phrase; but there is
no classical dramatic composition. In all its declamation
and debate <i>Jephthes</i> has little dramatic movement. The
long speeches of <i>Baptistes</i> hardly achieve even characterization.
If Buchanan had learned from Euripides what
made <i>Medea</i> a play, he was not making one himself; he
was casting Latin poetry in dialogue and dividing oratory
into five acts. In this he is typical of humanistic Latin
tragedy. Learned, allusive, competent in style, it is not
drama.</p>

<p>Classical tragedy in the vernacular is sufficiently exemplified
by Robert Garnier (1544-1590, <i>Œuvres</i>, ed.
Lucien Pinvert, Paris, 1923, 2 vols.). Knowing Greek
tragedy as well as Seneca, appreciative, capable in style,
making some dramatic advance in his seven tragedies
from 1568 to 1583, he yet stopped short of the Greek
type of composition, the dramaturgy that reduces a story
to its crisis in order to move the play by compelling sequence
of action. For his tragedies, though some of them
may have been presented, were poems written to be read.</p>

<p>The argument of <i>Porcie</i> (1568) closes thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“Here, then, is the summary of the history on which I have
planned this tragedy. You will find it in Dio’s 47th book, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
Appian’s 4th and 5th, and in Plutarch’s lives of Cicero, Brutus,
and Antony. I have also interwoven the fiction of the death
of the Nurse, to involve it further with gloom and sorrow and
make the catastrophe more bloody.”</p>

<p>Act I consists of (1) a monologue by the Fury Mégère, a
fine piece to say, and (2) a chorus of six rhymed stanzas. It
is rather a prelude than an act.</p>

<p>In Act II Portia’s monologue is followed by a chorus imitating
Horace’s second Epode, and the Nurse’s monologue by
their dialogue and another Horatian chorus. There is no action.
The dialogue gives a hint of characterization when Portia in
her doubt and fear regrets the death of Caesar.</p>

<p>Act III. Upon a Senecan monologue by Areus breaks Octavius
to announce the rout and death of Brutus. The ensuing
dialogue of balanced contrasts passes to Senecan speeches.
After a chorus Antony vaunts the deeds of his mythical ancestors
and his own prowess. The only function of Ventidius
is to listen. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, in balanced dialogue,
then in longer speeches, agree to divide the world. The
chorus of soldiers rejoices in the prospect of booty.</p>

<p>Act IV brings the rout and death of Brutus to Portia by
messenger. Her long tirades culminate in her speech on receiving
the urn of ashes, and are followed by a chorus.</p>

<p>Act V is an epilogue. The Nurse reports the death of
Portia, and engages in responsive lyrics with the chorus of
soldiers.</p>

</div>

<p>Not really five acts, then, but three frame a piece without
dramatic action. Though it is focused on a brief
period, it does not thereby realize dramatic sequence. Consisting
of oratory and lyric, it is conceived as a poem, not
as a play.</p>

<p>The style, careful in the balances of the dialogue, has
effective oratorical iteration: “C’est trop, c’est trop duré,
c’est trop acquis.”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of the same type are the two tragedies of 1574,
<i>Hippolyte</i> and <i>Cornélie</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Act I of <i>Cornélie</i> is again a prelude consisting of a fine
monologue and a chorus. In II Cornelia and Cicero remind
each other of the past and moralize on human life. The
theme of mutability, carried out in the chorus, ends on the
hope of another deliverance from tyrants. In III the chorus
continues this theme after dialogue with Cornelia and her
receiving of Pompey’s ashes. IV brings on first Cassius and
Brutus, then Caesar and Antony. V, though more nearly an
act, makes extravagant use of the messenger.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Marc-Antoine</i> (1578), surer perhaps in its oratory and
finer in its lyric, is no more dramatic.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Philostratus, a minor person, is added (II. i) merely to expound
the situation in a monologue. Octavius and Agrippa
appear only in IV. Lucilius is in III only to receive the exhalations
of Antony; and Charmion has little more function
in II and V. Once more V is mainly a series of tirades. Act
II, scene iii adds to Cleopatra’s oratory a flash of jealousy
and the suggestion of Diomedes that she save the situation
by using her fatal beauty on Caesar; but neither is carried out.</p>

</div>

<p>In <i>La Troade</i> (1579) Garnier turned to Euripides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Act I, for the first time more than a prelude, consists nevertheless,
after Hecuba’s opening monologue, of responsive
lyrics between her and the chorus. The envoy Talthybius arrives
toward the end. Act II, mainly a debate between Andromache
and Ulysses, introduces Helen and Astyanax and
closes with a chorus. Act III, bringing back Hecuba and
Talthybius, adds Pyrrhe, Agamemnon, Calchas, and Polyxena.
Act IV brings together Hecuba and Andromache. The murder
of Astyanax and the death, already forecast, of Polyxena are
announced by messenger. Act V gives main place to Polymestor,
who appears for the first time. The act is in effect
an appendix, adding the <i>Hecuba</i> of Euripides to Seneca.</p>

</div>

<p>Evidently Garnier has not grasped the composing habit
of Greek tragedy. At most he has managed somewhat
more interaction between such groups of persons as he
had begun by keeping apart in separate acts. He is working
at literature, not at drama. Hence his evident intelligence
carries his experience only so far. The argument of
<i>Antigone</i> (1580) cites the Theban plays of all three
great Greek dramatists, and adds Statius to Seneca. The
plot generally uses Seneca for the first three acts, the
<i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles for the last two. The combination
is rather piecing than fusion, and shows no appreciation
of the dramaturgy of Sophocles. In 1582 Garnier was
adventurous enough to attempt a dramatization of Ariosto.
<i>Bradamante</i>, which he calls a tragicomedy,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> is hardly
more than a division of certain parts of the <i>Orlando</i> into
scenes which are far from being dramatic units. As in the
earlier plays, the five acts are in effect three. Some characterization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
is achieved in the minor persons Aymon and
Beatrix. Bradamante herself is chosen, of course, for those
lyric tirades with which Ariosto had delighted the
century.</p>

<p>But Garnier lived to vindicate tragedy within his own
limits. <i>Les Juifves</i> (1583) has more values for representation
and, in the pervasive suggestion of the inextinguishable
mission of Israel, a certain unity of tone. “The
subject is taken,” says the argument, “from the 24th
and 25th chapters of the fourth book of Kings, the
36th chapter of the second book of Chronicles, and the
29th chapter of Jeremiah, and is more amply treated by
Josephus in the 9th and 10th chapters of his Antiquities.”</p>

<p>The persons are the Prophet, Nebuchadnezzar, Nabuz,
and Amital; the Jewish Queens and Nebuchadnezzar’s
Queen; a Duenna and a Provost; and the frequently appearing
Chorus. Two other main persons, Zedekiah and
the High Priest, appear first in IV; the Prophet, only in
I and V. As in the earlier tragedies, I is a monologue of
lamentation on the Captivity plus a chorus, that is, an
expository prelude; and V, reporting the slaughter of the
children, is an epilogue urging submission to the will of
God and the hope of deliverance by Cyrus. Though the
groups are somewhat better combined, there is little
change in the habit of composition.</p>

<p>Such effectiveness as this tragedy has beyond spectacle
is mainly lyric. The abundant choruses and responses are
both expert as verse and inspired by Psalms and Prophets
to eloquence: Adieu, native land (II. v); How shall we
sing in a strange land? (III. iii); Wretched daughters of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Sion (IV. i). Though there is some interaction of plea
and refusal, some suspense, all the decisions have been
made beforehand. There remain to animate a play the
sight and sound of communal fortitude. <i>Les Juifves</i> is a
noble poem; its literary type is still clear in the nobler
<i>Samson Agonistes</i> of Milton.</p>

<p>That Garnier’s classicism is thoroughly of his time is
vouched by forty editions in less than thirty years. He was
classical superficially in following the custom of mythological
ornament. He was classical further in imitations
on classical themes with classical persons, and still further
in going from Seneca to Euripides and even to Sophocles.
But his classicism kept sixteenth-century limits in looking
away from composition to style. As to the Middle Age,
dramatic meant to his time not a distinctive movement,
but a certain style. Though he was intelligent and serious
enough to use Seneca in his own way, less than the
Elizabethans for melodrama, more for moral urgency, he
did not see beyond the Senecan conception of drama as
oratory plus lyric. He found his own oratory, his own
lyric; but his progress was rather in tragic diction than
in tragedy.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VI_3">3. HISTORY PLAYS</h3>

<p>The most distinctive Elizabethan stage experiments of
the waning sixteenth century were the “histories.” Generally
lacking focus, series rather than sequence, often
made over, sometimes nationalistic propaganda, they still
keep some of their Elizabethan stir. For the putting of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
great men on the stage not only satisfied a story appetite
growing too fast for print; it showed prowess, as no story
can quite show, in action. Thus a history play, though it
might be tragedy only in the medieval sense of the fall
of a prince, though it might be Senecan enough in style,
might teach stage values beyond Seneca. Widening the
field of tragedy beyond Greek legend to the opening
East and to national history, it also opened other methods
of characterization and other dramatic forms than were
taught by either the Greek or the Latin tradition.</p>

<p>The story play, then, should not be ruled out as <i>a priori</i>
undramatic. Aristotelian theory and classical experience
exhibit dramatic movement as typically distinct from narrative,
not the telling of the story, but the compelling of
its crisis to an emotional issue. In this aspect the Greek
tragic theater exhibits sharp contrasts to the Elizabethan:
the one vast, open, removing the audience so far as to
compel orotund delivery and preclude facial expression,
the other small, closed, bringing the audience so near as
to invite facial play and even aside; the one limited to a
few persons, the other inviting many; the one unifying
plot for the sake of unbroken, cumulative sequence to an
inevitable issue, the other dispersing it over time and
space for narrative values and for individualizing characterization;
the one crisis play, the other story play. But
the contrast is not absolute, nor does it establish exclusive
superiority. Greek tragedy is too great in its kind to need
any cult of it as the <i>beau idéal</i>. The sixteenth century
might have progressed faster for understanding that
dramaturgy; but Shakspere came before Corneille and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
by another road. Elizabethan drama, often bungling,
sometimes sprawling at first, and slow to master the essentially
dramatic method of interaction, was yet a school
of various experience. Though the experience of the
“histories” was valuable mainly as preparatory, it also
vindicated the dramatic validity of a story play.</p>

<p>Marlowe’s <i>Tamburlaine</i> (1587) is poetry not only in
what the Middle Age called high style, but in dramatic
conception. Though his sequel failed to make it a tragedy,
it is history brought home in heroic action. The fourth
act, indeed, lapses into spectacle; the fifth pushes the
ruthlessness beyond credibility, and the close is a formal
gesture; but for three acts we are in the thick. Not sustained
as a sequence, this activity is nevertheless dramatic
to the extent of being typically distinct from Seneca. For
all its oratory, <i>Tamburlaine</i> is story in action. Thus was
opened the way for Shakspere’s “histories” of the 90’s.
We shall do his revolting <i>Richard III</i> more justice if we
neither excuse it as carrying over an earlier appeal of
blood, nor blame it for failing to focus the monster in a
tragedy. <i>Richard III</i> is not tragedy dulled by dispersion;
it is dramatic story, dramatic in the interactions of that
princely world poisoned by treachery, story in cumulative
damnation. Shakspere had written the <i>Merchant of
Venice</i> and was writing <i>As You Like It</i>, when he put on
another “history” in <i>Henry V</i> (1599).</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VI_4">4. PASTORAL AND RUSTIC COMEDY</h3>

<p>Before the dramatic experience of the “histories” bore
its best fruit in a widening of tragedy, another sort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
story enriched comedy. Dramatic training through Latin
comedy had been continuous from the Middle Age
through the Renaissance. As Ariosto had begun with
<i>I suppositi</i> in 1509, so Shakspere wrote the <i>Comedy of
Errors</i> in 1591. In Latin and in vernacular, in translation
and in imitation, the quick, smart formula of Plautus and
Terence<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> continued its lessons. But the abundant Renaissance
pageantry of solemn entries, the court shows, and
the vogue of pastoral, had yielded here and there some
dramatic experience. This is evident as early as Poliziano,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
whose <i>Orfeo</i> is classical in its pagan gods and demigods,
specifically pastoral in its shepherds. It is also myth, both
in the original story of Orpheus and Eurydice and in
Poliziano’s shaping. His myth is effective spectacle; his
dialogue more than conventional responses. He has action
enough to conclude upon vociferous melodrama. <i>Orfeo</i> is
a play so far as it goes; but it is too brief to make its
dramatic sequence convincing. Mythological drama is
rather opened than established. In 1573 Tasso, fulfilling
a similar commission for a court show at Urbino, conformed
his <i>Aminta</i><a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> strictly to unity of place and time.
But its sequence, though uninterrupted, is hardly dramatic.
It proceeds oftener by musical recitative than by action.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
Lovely to see and hear, it gives more hints for opera than
for drama. Battista Guarini (1538-1612), professor of
rhetoric and poetic at Ferrara, and chief court poet after
the withdrawal of Tasso, spent years on his pastoral
drama <i>Il pastor fido</i>.</p>

<p>Begun in 1580, finished in 1583, read aloud, revised,
it was finally published at Venice 1589/90. Apparently it
was first staged in 1595. The Venice edition of 1602 is
the twentieth. Called tragicomedy, tragedy in its crisis
of life and death, comedy in its satyr and in its happy
issue, it is above all, in its persons, its scene, its mythology,
consistently pastoral. A prologue celebrating Arcadia as a
blest retreat of peace, and Caterina d’Este as worthy of her
illustrious house, is spoken by the river Alfeo. Besides
this personification, and four choruses, there are eighteen
personae. Of these the majority are servants or companions
serving merely as interlocutors. Three, the temple
officiant Nicander, Corisca’s lover Corydon, and a messenger,
are quite superfluous. No person is characterized
except as a type: the hero Mirtillo as a devotedly faithful
lover, the heroine Amaryllis as virtuous, Corisca as a
plotter. All are duly paganized.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. The play opens with old Linco’s advice to athletic young
Silvio: go love betimes. A dialogue between Mirtillo expounds
the plot. Corisca’s monologue tells the audience that she is in
love with Mirtillo, and must have revenge for his disdain.
Three elders, Tityrus, the priest Montano, and Dameta,
further expound the situation in reminiscence. A satyr, in a
monologue on love, vows to seize the tricky Corisca. The
persons having been thus presented in separate sets, the act
ends with a chorus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>II. Mirtillo tells Ergasto how he fell in love forever with
Amaryllis. Dorinda in vain woos Silvio by detaining and restoring
his hound. Corisca’s monologue exults in the outlook
of her plot, and her dialogue misleading Amaryllis ends with
soliloquy. The satyr seizing her, she cajoles, insults, and
finally breaks away, thus providing action for the first time.
The concluding chorus moralizes the past.</p>

<p>III. Mirtillo, after apostrophizing spring and love, is
brought, through a game of nymphs devised by Corisca, to
Amaryllis, declares his passion, exchanges longer and longer
speeches, and finding her obdurate, vows to die. In a monologue
she tells the audience that she loves him nevertheless.
Corisca tricks them separately into seeking a cave. Each exhales
a monologue on the way. This is the complication. The
satyr unwittingly furthers it by blocking the cave with a rock,
thus imprisoning the two innocents. The chorus meditates on
love.</p>

<p>IV. At this point all that remains of the action is to disclose
Corisca’s trick, correct the mistaken identity, and reveal
the true intent of the oracle. But since the play must have
five acts Guarini reserves all this to V, and makes IV a
stalling interlude of monologues, reports, and choruses. The
only action is in the last scene (ix), where Silvio, accidentally
wounding Dorinda, begins to fall in love with her.</p>

<p>V. Mirtillo’s foster-father, arriving from far, finds him about
to be sacrificed, having offered himself in place of Amaryllis.
The disclosure that these two are the fated couple meant by
the oracle is made gradually through five scenes, and capped
by the arrival of the blind seer Tirenio in vi. Silvio is reported
duly in love with the healed Dorinda. Even Corisca is pardoned;
and the play ends with hymeneal choruses.</p>

</div>

<p>The play is not moved by the actions of its persons.
Complication, indeed, comes through Corisca, who is
the only person carried through the play; but the solution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
is through persons brought in at the end solely for that
purpose. As with Garnier, the persons are presented in
separate groups; and they are on the stage to talk. The
style is expertly careful. Guarini has learned from Tasso
how to modulate his verse. The notes record constant
reminiscences of the classics, both Greek and Latin, and
many borrowings; but the surcharging, again after the
example of Tasso, is discreetly harmonized. Pastoral
drama, then, rather prolonged pastoral than advanced
drama. But its opportunities for spectacle, dance, music,
and imaginative suggestion were among the motives
finally woven into a play by Shakspere.</p>

<p>Meantime real rustics also, actual farmers, laborers,
villagers, had long been dramatized for gentlefolk and
bourgeois by amateurs and increasingly by professional
companies. Angelo Beolco (1502-1542), called from
one of his favorite impersonations Ruzzante, even
localized them on the stage in Ferrara and Venice by
Paduan dialect. As the shepherds of the Towneley <i>Secunda
pastorum</i>, his rustics are presented realistically. Here is
the essential difference from pastoral. The actual rudeness
of such impersonations, may, indeed, be dramatically exaggerated;
but it must always seem actual. Ruzzante’s
vivid realizations transcend his Paduan dialect by the
appeal of actual peasant life, rudeness, shrewdness, lewdness
unveiled by the social conventions of a higher society,
talking in their own terms. Such rustic drama in time
helped to discover a dramatic interest beyond types in
individuals. Types remain useful in comedy because they
are readily recognizable, the braggart soldier or the clever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
rascal; and dramatic theory urges nothing more. But the
stage attempts with rustic persons sometimes opened in
comedy of manners the further appeal of characterization.
The verisimilitude and propriety of the theorists gave
way to dramatic creation. As later in the “histories,” so
in rustic comedies, theory was widened by stage experience.</p>

<p>Ruzzante’s life was too short to bring his art to maturity.
At forty, though he had already triumphed in single
characterizations, he was still groping in the forms of
Plautus. Much of his work is what is now called sketch,
rather dialogue or even monologue than play.</p>

<p>A characteristic piece is his <i>First Dialogue</i>. A soldier,
reminiscent here and elsewhere of the <i>miles gloriosus</i>, but
characterized with some individuality, is returning from
the war ragged and wistful, but still boastful. Catechized
by an old friend, he gives his experiences, his theory of
life, and something of himself. So far the form is hardly
more than monologue; for the friend merely listens, questions,
and comments. There is no interaction. The effect,
however, even in print, is dramatic to the extent of vivid
representation. The racy language has constant suggestions
of manner, gesture, stage business. It differs essentially
from the diction of Garnier. We come to know this man.</p>

<p>Then the soldier meets his wife. She is interested, not
moved. Having had to shift for herself in his absence,
she cannot now break off convenient relations for sentiment.
Here is interaction, even a situation, and the lines
given to the man and to the woman clearly suggest it;
but more than lines are needed to make it a play. So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Ruzzante took this second part for the motive of his
<i>Second Dialogue</i>. He saw the situation; he gave it some
complication, and closed upon violent action; but he did
not sustain the interaction of man and woman, and his
third person, her senile lover, remains almost separate.</p>

<p>So Ruzzante’s collected pieces<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> generally show less
achievement than promise. He was learning rapidly from
the stage itself. Imperfect playwright at his untimely
death, he was already famous as a writer and actor of
“parts.” These Italian stage experiments of the 1530’s
were essentially like the Elizabethan fifty years later in
giving to an old field new stage values. Though they
had rather a local success than any general influence, they
are significant now for what they opened.</p>

<p>In 1586 John Lyly gave the persons of his <i>Endymion</i>
Greek or Latin names. But the myth suggested by his title
does not take shape as plot. Indeed, there is hardly any
action, none that is dramatically determining. The persons
are on the stage to talk, the main persons in orations, the
Latin-comedy servants in repartee. Endymion’s dream is
presented by a dumb show in Act II, and recounted in
Act IV. The close is flatly by Cynthia’s fiat. The allegory,
clearer of course to the audience than to us, seems to be
both personification of qualities and suggestion of actual
persons, as in Spenser’s <i>Faerie Queene</i>. In both aspects
it now makes a dull play duller.</p>

<p>Peele’s <i>Old Wives’ Tale</i> is as random as its title, adding
rustics to classics and allegory to folklore. Not a story<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
play, it is a collection of little shows, each rather for itself
than for any sequence. The folklore material and the
rustics are interesting; the play is not. That anything so
shapeless could have gained the stage in 1590 is sufficient
evidence of Elizabethan willingness to experiment.
Within five years Shakspere found the dramatic solution
of myth and pastoral, folklore and rustics, for court show
in the <i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>. Forthwith Lyly’s
pedantic encomium and clumsy dumb show, Peele’s jolly
rustics and half-fairies, become as antiquated as the many
Elizabethan gropings through the moralities and pastoral.
The court show has arrived at fairyland. For this is all
faery: the ancient heroic world from Boccaccio and
Chaucer, and the sprites with classical names. The classical
story of Pyramus and Thisbe is transmitted by rustics;
and Bottom himself is translated. Through all hovers the
authentic elfin minister Puck.</p>

<p><i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> is a complete fusion, not
only of style as Tasso’s <i>Aminta</i>, but also in dramatic movement.
As Theseus, Puck, and Bottom, the lovers and
yokels, are all conformed to the same world, so they all
interact in a single sequence toward a uniting issue.
Even the place is single. Such slight shifts as there may
have been in the Elizabethan theater are negligible; for
of all its many presentations the most convincing have
stayed on a lawn before a green thicket. <i>Midsummer
Night’s Dream</i> is a one-act play, Greek dramaturgy beyond
Garnier’s or Tasso’s. But instead of saying that
Shakspere conformed to the dramatic unities, we should
rather say that he learned the dramatic importance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
holding fairyland together. Sixteenth-century stage experience,
then, as well as classical theory and imitation,
opened the great drama of the seventeenth century. The
experience of court shows with the feebleness of allegory,
the escape of pastoral, the vitality of rustic realism,
opened the way for both romantic and realistic comedy.
The experience of the “histories” opened a new appeal
in tragedy. For Corneille, as well as Shakspere, was a man
of the stage.</p>

<p>The revival of classical Latin was promoted by manuals
and discussions, and accompanied by still others
directed to vernacular poetry. Though none of these ranks
as a poetic in the sense of a contribution to the theory of
poetry, not a few reveal or define habits of thought and
taste, directions of study, literary ideals and methods.
Thus their importance, far beyond their intrinsic values, is
in their clues to literary preoccupations and trends, their
indications for a Renaissance weather map.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_1">1. VIDA</h3>

<p>The ecclesiastic, Marco Girolamo Vida, addressed his
three cantos of Latin hexameters <i>De arte poetica</i> (1527)
to the Dauphin, son of Francis I, with due invocation of
the Muses.</p>

<p class="noindent">It invites noble youth to write Latin poetry. The doctrine
is mainly an expansion of the “Ars poetica” of Horace;<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
the exemplar is Vergil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Though heroic poetry is the highest, choose according to
your talent heroic or dramatic, elegiac or pastoral. Let the great
work wait while you sound and explore it; but meantime
seize those parts that come at once, and make a prose sketch
of the whole. The preparation of schooling in poetic and
rhetoric is necessary as training in appreciation. [The rest of
the canto is addressed, over the pupil’s shoulder, to teachers.]
Greek, established in Italy by the Medici, and especially
Homer, stimulate comparison. Of the Latins, the Augustans,
especially Vergil, have first claim. The others may wait till
taste has been matured by these. The master’s function is to
awaken and guide love of the best poetry without forcing it.
Even recreation may be pointed by classical suggestions. Calf
love must be handled with care. So soon as young ardor has
penetrated through passion to poetry, the boy should study
its monuments and taste the other arts. Though travel is useful,
and some experience of war, the central thing is unremitting
study of the poets. Thus metric, instead of remaining
merely a set of rules, becomes the testing of one’s own adjustments
by memories of reading, the oral revision of a mind
full of great poetry. Young ambitions should not be quelled
by too severe criticism, nor lack the privilege of retirement
and freedom. The world that grudges these owes its glory
nevertheless to poets, who have sacrificed worldly rewards to
live in their own peace. As the fire stolen by Prometheus,
poetry is a divine gift.</p>

<p>II. The second canto repeats Horace’s counsel: begin on a
subdued tone and at the crisis (<i>in mediis</i>). The action, planned
as a whole and clearly forecast, should control the description.
Greek is more tolerant of descriptive dilation than is
becoming to us Latins. Need I caution against the dilation
that comes from gratuitous display of erudition? The detail
of Vulcan’s shield for Aeneas has the point of exhibiting the
history of Rome. Variety has its claims; but rolls of kings,
legends, myths, comic relief, though delightful as description,
should not deviate. Be careful of verisimilitude. Do not plan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
for length. Work day and night on a conception limited and
tried out this way and that. If amplification seems desirable
afterward, Vergil shows many ways. [The citations are mainly
descriptive.] Inspiration comes when it will, and does not
obviate revision. Study nature: the ways of age, of youth, of
woman, of servants and of kings, for appropriateness, as in
Vergil; for so you learn to move, as Vergil by Euryalus. Study
in others, especially in the ancient Greeks, their conceptions
(<i>inventa</i>) without hesitating to borrow as Vergil from Homer.
So may Rome ever excel in the arts and teach the world. Alas
for our discords and the bringing in of foreign tyrants!
though distant nations had already honored Tuscan Leo and
the Medici. The crusade against the Saracens became only a
dream.</p>

<p>III. Flee obscurity; let poetry be clear in its own light.
Vary to avoid repetition. Figures give vividness to both poetry
and oratory; but verse is freer with hyperbole, metonymy,
personification. Figures should avoid display, incongruity,
dilation. Style must always be appropriate. Follow the classics,
use suggestions from other poets, adapting the old to the
new, even borrowing. As a poet need not fear new words that
are already recognizable, so he may go to Greek, as his classical
ancestors before him. He may venture cautiously on
archaism, periphrasis, compounds, adaptations. Never let
words carry you beyond your meaning, except to serve the
music of verse. Verse is a shrine closed to the mass of men,
open to the few by a narrow way. For it must range beyond
mere correctness to harmony with the persons, with the scene,
with each of the three styles. Such counsels, sure as they are,
will not guarantee high achievement. That can be given only
by Apollo. Let us close by celebrating the supreme poet Vergil.</p>

</div>

<p>Commonplaces of rhetoric, from a source commonplace
for centuries, why were these put into elegant
Vergilian hexameters? Hardly to make the Dauphin a
Latin poet; hardly to interpret what was already too well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
known; hardly to advance poetic. The poem is an exhibition
of competence in learning, in teaching, and in Latin
verse, a sort of thesis for the degree of humanist. The
person that it seeks to establish as a Latin poet is its
author.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_2">2. TRISSINO</h3>

<p><i>The seven divisions of poetic</i> (1529, enlarged 1563)
by Giovan Giorgio Trissino occupy the first 139 pages of
the second volume of his collected works (Verona, 1729).
The first four divisions are devoted to diction, metric,
and verse forms. The fifth and sixth are substantially an
Italian paraphrase of Aristotle’s <i>Poetic</i><a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> with insertions
from the “Ars poetica” of Horace. Trissino repeats Aristotle
without grasp of his distinctive ideas. He has read
also Dionysius of Halicarnassus (105); he has the independence
to disparage Seneca (101); and he considers
why Dante called his great work <i>Commedia</i> (120); but
he thinks that pastoral eclogue is of the same poetic genus
as comedy, and he does not make clear that Aristotle’s
distinction of dramatic from epic is in composition.
Though Trissino had not penetration enough to be constructive,
or even suggestive, he opened Aristotle early in
the century to the wider circle.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_3">3. GIRALDI CINTHIO</h3>

<p>Giraldi Cinthio published together two essays on the
composition of romances,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> comedies, and tragedies (<i>Discorsi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
... intorno al comporre de i romanzi, delle
commedie, e delle tragedie ...</i> Venice, 1554). In the
one on comedy and tragedy (pages 199-287, written in
1543) he moves, as Trissino, over the surface of Aristotle’s
<i>Poetic</i> without grasping the import of poetic as a
distinct form of composition. For style he even prefers
Seneca (220) to the Greeks. In the essay on verse
romances (pages 1-198, written in 1549) he speaks of
having presented the subject in oral teaching, and refers
(4) to Vicentio Maggio’s lectures on Aristotle.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The word <i>romance</i> has the same meaning with us as epic with
the Romans (5); and the form originated in France (6).
Considering first the plot (<i>favola</i>), as Aristotle bids, we see
in Boiardo and Ariosto that romance is the adorning (<i>abbellimento</i>)
of the strife of Christians with their enemies (9).
Though thus like epic or tragedy in imitating illustrious deeds,
romance has not a single action (12), but several, perhaps
eight or ten. Its organization (<i>orditura</i>) is unhappily compared
to that of the human body: the subject being the skeleton;
the order of parts, the nerves; the beautification, the
skin; the animation, the soul. This is the plan of the treatise.</p>

<p>A single action is too restrictive for romance (22), whose
many actions are more desirable, as conducive to variety (25).
But the actions should be connected in a continuous chain
(<i>continua catena</i>) and have verisimilitude. The parts should
cohere as the parts of the human body. The poem should be
fleshed out at suitable places (26) with fillings (<i>riempimenti</i>):
loves, hates, laments, descriptions of places, of seasons,
of persons, tales made up or taken from the ancients,
voyages, wanderings, marvels [in short, anything for sophistic
display]. For there is nothing in heaven above, nor in the
earth beneath, nor in the very depth of the abyss, which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
not at the call of the judicious poet—provided (27) each be
appropriate in itself and to the whole.</p>

</div>

<p>The appended proviso is irrelevant in theory and was
not observed in practice. The age of classicism is faced
with the fact that its most evident and most popular poetic
achievement is not classical in composition. Renaissance
romance does not follow the epic formula. True, Ariosto
does begin in <i>mediis rebus</i> (23), as Horace bids; but
even that is not obligatory for a “manifold action”; and
evidently the action may be not merely manifold, but
plural. By “continuous chain” Giraldi means not sequence
of the whole, but merely transitions; not connection, but
connectives (40, 41).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Our romancers may have learned this from Claudian (41).
The breaking off of an action creates suspense; and the main
stories remain in suspense to the completion of the whole
poem (42). Besides, variety is itself an added beauty. Why
must romances be limited to the epic way (44)? Ovid did not
follow Vergil (45). But the parts and the episodes must have
the connection of verisimilitude (55).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It seems difficult for Giraldi to think in terms of composition.
Once more we arrive at verisimilitude; and we
go on to appropriateness (<i>il decoro</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">This he has touched earlier in reprehending Homer (31) for
letting Nausicaa wash clothes. Here (63-65) he insists that
romance, in bringing on kings as well as shepherds and
nymphs, must make each consistent with his type. After pausing
to disagree with the Italian followers of Hermogenes, he
passes to style (83-159), including verse. The section on
verse, sometimes dubious, is often suggestive, as on Ariosto’s
admirable facility (145) in making verse run as easily as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
prose [i.e., without inversions]. Petrarch is cited (147) as
the ideal combination of weight and ease.</p>

<p>The concluding section (160-184) on the soul of the poem
manages to lean even more on rhetoric. In oratory <i>anima</i> depends
on delivery; in poetry, not only on this, but on such
expressive words as put things before our eyes (<i>energia, sotto
gli occhi</i>). An appendix (188-197) repeats the Horatian
counsels on advice and revision.</p>

</div>

<p>The main significance of the treatise in 1549 is its
recognition of the actual difference of romance from epic.
Giraldi’s attempts at reconciling the two in theory seem
evasions because he misses Aristotle’s controlling view
of poetic as having its own ways of sequence, distinct
from those of rhetoric.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_4">4. MUZIO</h3>

<p>Muzio published among his Italian poems a poetic in
verse (<i>Rime diverse del Mutio Iustinopolitano: tre libri
di arte poetica ...</i> Venice, 1551). Diffused through some
1,600 lines (pages 68-94), it is often thin and sometimes
vague, the sort of treatise written not to teach, nor much
to theorize, but to express the author’s culture and taste
via Horace’s “Ars poetica.” What individuality it has
transpires for the most part incidentally; but the treatment
of metric is fairly distinctive.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Why use Greek terms: ode, hymn, epigram, elegy (71*)?
Why talk of dactyls and spondees (72)? The difference between
quantitative and accentual verse forbids the transfer.
You will make a hodgepodge like Coccai’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">“The ear cannot respond surely to quantity and time where
the tongue must follow the stress” is at once penetrative and,
in the face of the classicists, daring. After conventional remarks
on verse as expressing that harmony which in nature
we see to be divine, and on the ancient relation to the dance,
he finds the joining of lyre with song in <i>ottava rima</i> (77)
and in <i>stanza</i> (86). The Greeks and Romans, using hexameter
for all “three styles,” did not even adapt their verse to tragedy
or to comedy (88*) by the length of the line. Our unrhymed
verse (<i>versi sciolti</i>) is appropriate to proud and lofty emprise
(88*). For purity of style it is not enough to be born
in Tuscany. Seek usage in books (70*). Tuscan is not confined
to Petrarch. He was pure and fluent above all others—and
perhaps more timid than becomes a poet (71).</p>

</div>

<p>The treatment of imitation (69*, 70, 82) and of
sentences (68*, 90*, 91, 93) is conventional. Sophistic
appears in the recipes for verisimilitude through appropriateness
(77-78) and in the recommendation of show-pieces
(Aetna, winter, spring, etc. 83). But Muzio at
once makes a significant addition. “You might yourself
look at nature, not merely seek it in books. Learn what
to dilate, what to compress.” As examples of the force of
restraint (84) he cites Vergil’s mating of Dido and
Aeneas in the cave and Dante’s Paolo and Francesca.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_5">5. FRACASTORO</h3>

<p>A Latin dialogue (1555) by Girolamo Fracastoro discusses
poetry as a form of eloquence, merging poetic in
rhetoric (<i>Hieronymi Fracastorii Naugerius sive de poetica
dialogus ...</i> with an English translation by Ruth Kelso
and an introduction by Murray W. Bundy, University of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
Illinois Press, 1924). Ciceronian in type, it is clearly
ordered and composed, and agreeably fluent in style.
Fracastoro’s motive is not professional. Scientist and
philosopher, he turns to poetry as to an important item
in culture and a suggestive topic for discussion. So approached
by not a few Renaissance scholars, it imposed
no obligation to advance critical theory.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_6">6. PELETIER</h3>

<p><i>L’Art poétique</i> of Jacques Peletier du Mans is a similar
excursion of a scholar into literature. Philosopher and
mathematician as Fracastoro, interested in languages,
professor, promoter of normalized spelling, he was
known, by that adjective dear to the French Renaissance,
as “docte Peletier.” His literary associations were first
with Ronsard and Du Bellay under Jean Dorat at the
Collège de Coqueret; later he had associations in Lyon,
where Jean de Tournes published his treatise in 1555
(<i>L’art poëtique</i> ... publié d’après l’édition unique avec
introduction et commentaire [par] André Boulanger,
Paris, 1930).</p>

<p>His editor, regarding it as the best formulation of the
Pléiade movement, notes that it relies on Horace’s “Ars
poetica” [which Peletier had translated ten years before],
Cicero, and Quintilian, that it uses no Greek source and
of the Italians only Vida, that the great model is Vergil,
and that the section on dramaturgy is slight and feeble.
He sums up the doctrine as: (1) use your vernacular and
enrich it; (2) imitate the ancients; (3) imitate nature;
(4) cultivate the high poetic forms urged by the Pléiade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>The little that Peletier has to say on poetic composition
is all rhetoric. He makes, for example, the usual transfer
of the counsels for <i>exordium</i> to the opening of a poem.
He shows the sophistic slant in turning to encomium the
Horatian commonplace that poets are givers of fame
(71, 82, 89, 176) and in the stock show-pieces (127).
He is more distinctive on rhyme (149), on classification
of meters by the number of syllables (153), and on imitation
of classical verse forms (159). He occasionally
cites Ariosto (103, 201) and discusses both the sonnet
and the ode (169, 172).</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_7">7. MINTURNO</h3>

<p>Minturno made his more comprehensive and influential
Latin dialogue on classical poetic, <i>De poeta</i>, a collection
of six monologues, or essays, with enough question and
objection for occasional reminder of the literary form,
but with little real discussion (<i>Antonii Sebastiani Minturni
de poeta ... libri sex</i>, Venice, 1559). The setting,
a villa by the sea, is elaborately described in the introduction.
The style, oratorical and inclined to Ciceronianism,
is throughout elaborate and diffuse, each noun being
habitually escorted by two adjectives. What is thus conveyed
with much repetition is generally Horace’s “Ars
poetica” once more, Cicero, and Quintilian; but there is
also considerable use, though little comprehension, of
Aristotle’s <i>Poetic</i>. Aristotle’s conception of poetry as a
distinct kind of composition has not yet arrived; and
poetic style, which is Minturno’s actual subject, is conceived
in the terms of rhetoric. The spokesmen are: Book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
I Sincerus (Sannazaro) on What is poetry?; Book II Pontanus
(recalled, not present) on What is poetic?; Book
III Vopiscus on tragedy; Book IV Gauricus on comedy;
Book V Carbo on lyric; Book VI Sincerus on style. The
quotations adduced on the first two hundred pages show
the following proportions: Vergil above all (<i>Bucolics</i>, 55
lines; <i>Georgics</i>, 10 lines; <i>Aeneid</i>, 512 lines); Seneca, 101;
Horace (mainly “Ars poetica”), 99; Euripides (in Latin),
68; Sophocles (in Latin), 23.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. What is poetry? It is a <i>furor coelestis</i>. Wisdom and eloquence
being one, all who had it used to be called poets
(Moses, Theseus, Lycurgus, Solon); for poetry was the only
art of speech. Recovering now from medieval darkness, we
see Vergil as the exemplar of everything, Homer as comprehending
all philosophy. Poetry is imitation of nature [apparently
conceived as description]. Therefore Plato’s exclusion
is rejected. The imitation is narrative in epic, through <i>personae</i>
in dramatic poetry, and a combination of the two in melic.
That poetry is like painting (Horace’s “ut pictura poesis”) is
agreed. Poets seek variety rather than sequence, and prefer
violent or otherwise disturbed states of mind, considering the
[rhetorical] headings of appropriateness to habit, place, and
time. Plato’s preference of epic is approved against Aristotle’s
of tragedy.</p>

<p>II. What is poetic? [The implication of this book, as
throughout, is that poetic is rhetoric.] The ancient poets
thought their distinction to be not in verse, but in lore of
astronomy, optics, music, logic, history, geography. In <i>ratio
dicendi</i> historians are likest to poets. Vergil was expert in
rhetoric and logic as well as in cosmogony, morals, law and
polity, medicine, athletics, etc. Poetry belongs under <i>ratio
civilis</i>. Its object is to teach, to delight, to move [the stock
summary for oratory]. It must command the “three styles” in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
order to be always appropriate. The natural objection of
Traianus that this seems to be all rhetoric is answered by
citing the distinction of verse, by slipping back to the “three
styles,” and, as in a sort of desperation, by saying that the
poet’s distinctive gift is to move men to wonder (<i>admiratio</i>).
[Not only is this pure sophistic, but Minturno’s floundering
is due to his seeing no distinction at all. He always falls back
on rhetoric.] The poet, no less than the orator, must command
<i>inventio</i>, <i>dispositio</i>, <i>elocutio</i>, <i>memoria</i>, <i>pronuntiatio</i>. Tragedy
is discussed as a poem with parts like those of a speech and
with descriptive amplification. Its <i>personae</i> are to be fashioned
through the headings of rhetoric. “The other parts of an oration
with which the orator is concerned, division, confirmation,
rebuttal, conclusion, peroration, must also be observed
(<i>tenendae</i>) by the poet.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">A book inquiring what poetic is, including tragedy, and
quoting Aristotle, has not the faintest suggestion of a
distinctive poetic composition! It can translate Aristotle’s
complication and solution without seeing that his mainspring
is sequence, and consider his “recognition” as a
means of display.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Once more we are told that characterization must be true in
the sense of being true to type: Aeneas consistently <i>pius et
fortis</i>, Achilles <i>iracundus et magnanimus</i>, Ulysses <i>prudens et
callidus</i>, according to the headings of rhetoric. After a few
vague precepts on arrangement, and one more reminder of the
“three styles,” a close is at last found in the epic eminence of
Vergil.</p>

<p>III. (Tragedy) is again conventional. With little use of
Aristotle, it reverts to Horace and Seneca, and repeats the
rhetorical doctrine of types. Tragedy is found to consist of
plot, character, words, and pregnant sentences (<i>fabula</i>, <i>mores</i>,
<i>verba</i>, <i>sententiae</i>). Its externals are described, its parts enumerated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
its origin summarized. It should have five acts of not
more than ten scenes each. Its style should be graphically
vivid. [To this counsel of rhetoric, which applies to drama
only in the reports of messengers, no hint is added of the
distinctive quality of dramatic dialogue.]</p>

<p>IV. (Comedy) after a review of the history of comedy and
an enumeration of its typical <i>personae</i>, is devoted largely to
a long list of figures used for comic effect, and closes with
enumeration of its parts.</p>

<p>V. (Lyric) after a long introduction on <i>convivium</i>, with
quotations from the poets, distinguishes melic from dithyrambic
and nomic, and finds that lyric has as many components as
drama (<i>fabula</i>, <i>mores</i>, <i>verba</i>, <i>sententiae</i>!). Its forms are ode
(with epode and palinode), satiric iambs, elegy (nenia, epicedium,
epitaphium, epithanatium), epigram in the Greek
sense, and satire.</p>

<p>VI. (Style) is a summary of the section on style in any
classical rhetoric, with classified examples and with the usual
lists of figures.</p>

</div>

<p>What is the result of these 570 pages? Five men of
letters, besides the author, have roles in a sort of published
academy; and several others at least take a hand.
They have no new ideas, except certain Aristotelian inklings
that hardly seem to fit. But they are learned in
rhetoric. They begin with the convention of the original
dominance of poetry; they end with sixty-two figures of
speech. The subject is reviewed; it is not advanced. As
guidance for Latin poets—but that is hardly intended. As
inspiration this oratory is much feebler than Poliziano’s;
and it never even approaches that brief, anonymous
ancient prose poem περι ὕψους, <i>De sublimitate</i>, “on
reaching up.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>Minturno’s other treatise, <i>Arte poetica</i> (1563), reduces
the dialogue form to catechism (<i>L’arte poetica del
signor Antonio Minturno, nella quale si contengono i
precetti eroici, tragici, comici, satirici ...</i> Naples, 1725).
Though there is some debate in Book I on the validity of
<i>romanzo</i> narrative, elsewhere the single interlocutor assigned
to each book merely asks the right questions. The
work is not a discussion; it is a manual of vernacular
poetry so analyzed under headings and sub-headings as
to be a book of reference. Systematic and detailed, its
doctrine is classical in referring everything ultimately to
ancient principles. Its exemplification is abundant, with
the usual preference for Petrarch.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Book I, discussing epic, includes the <i>Divina Commedia</i> and
Petrarch’s <i>Trionfi</i>, and insists that the lack of unity in Ariosto’s
<i>Orlando</i> is a cardinal fault. If the teaching of the ancients
“and the example of Homer’s poetry is true, I do not see how
another, different from that, is admissible; for truth is one.
Therefore the variation of later times will not suffice as a warrant
for letting a poem treat more than one action, entire and
of just compass, to which everything else should be contributory”
(35). What offends Minturno especially is Ariosto’s
interruption and resumption.</p>

<p>Book II, discussing drama, though it gives a better account
of Aristotle’s theory than the <i>De poeta</i>, still cites Horace,
calls actors <i>recitanti</i>, and does not comprehend the idea of a
play as a sequence of action.</p>

<p>Book III, dealing with lyric forms, is especially ample as to
<i>canzone</i>. The triad of Pindar’s odes he calls <i>volta</i>, <i>rivolta</i>,
<i>stanza</i>. His own praises of Charles V consist of five such
triads. “As Pindar,” he goes on, “narrates the myths of Tantalus
and Pelops, so I told the landing of Aeneas in Africa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
and Hannibal’s invasion of Italy, with due reference to the
Trojan origin of the Romans and of the princely ancestors of
Charles” (183-184). After due citation of Dante the book
goes on to <i>sonetto</i>, <i>ballata</i>, and other forms with both quotation
and analysis, and even devotes a page to reminder of the
Latin hymns.</p>

<p>Book IV analyzes style under the headings of the classical
<i>elocutio</i> and <i>compositio</i>, and with detailed consideration of
metric. The counsels for imitation, though tolerating the usual
Renaissance closeness, stop short of Ciceronianism. The concluding
advice for revision is drawn from Horace.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_8">8. PARTENIO</h3>

<p>Bernardino Partenio devoted five books to <i>Imitation
in poetry</i> (<i>Della imitatione poetica ...</i> Venice, 1560).
A vernacular dialogue of the <i>De oratore</i> type, it achieves
little interchange of views and interposes much delay by
ceremonious introduction and interruption. At Murano,
near Venice, the main speakers are two elders, Trifone
and Trissino, and two younger, Paolo Manutio and
Lunisini. The literary fiction is of instructing the latter;
but whereas Lunisini remains most of the time silent,
Manutio speaks often and sometimes at length. A few
other persons pass across the background.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. After the conventional introduction of poetry as the original
philosophy, poetic composition is left to Aristotle and
Horace, and poetic style is proposed (7) for discussion by a
most confusing division: (1) <i>inventioni</i> through topics; (2)
<i>assontioni</i>, which also should mean topics, but are further
described as <i>commenti</i> and <i>fittione poetiche</i> (mythology);
(3) <i>ordine</i>, conceived as amplification and variation; (4) <i>affetti</i>,
passions and moral habit; (5) <i>epiteti</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>Imitation (11-13) is common, natural, even necessary, in
spite of objectors and of Pico’s assertion that what we should
follow is the <i>idea</i>, not the form. We may imitate a whole subject
(17), or particular <i>sententiae</i>, or words, changing the
order, amplifying or restricting, modifying. So did the ancients
(24); so Bembo imitated Petrarch (25); and Terence
defended his use of Menander (28). Camillo’s topics (34)
for poetical <i>inventio</i> are set forth with many examples. Partenio’s
application seems to amount to (1) mere periphrasis,
(2) concrete specification, (3) amplification.</p>

<p>II. The next book makes plainer that imitation is dilation,
especially in the direction of sophistic show-pieces (as in the
use of Catullus, 73). The book is not really distinct from I.
Perhaps that explains the padding (80 seq.) with discussion
of poetic diction: compounds, polysyllables, figures. It closes
with a survey of Sannazaro, Pontano, Fracastoro, Vida, Navagero,
and the chief of vernacular poets, Bembo (86).</p>

<p>III. Imitation may mean the expression of human life; but
specifically it is directed toward elegance of diction (93-95),
and may involve the lifting of phrases (98). The awareness
of style which comes from reading should be so confirmed by
imitation (105) as to insure a poetic fund (<i>copia</i>). Imitation
of style has always been legitimate (106), but with
variations (110). Boccaccio’s Ser Ciapeletto is dilated by a
list of specifications (119), and concludes, as it should, with
a <i>sententia</i>. But dilation demands also the use of topics (<i>assontioni</i>).
These are exhibited in tabular view (123) and exemplified
from Vergil, Horace, Catullus, and Petrarch.</p>

<p>IV. Further examples lead into mythology. Order of items
in the encomium recipe may be varied (155). Imitation of
passions is exemplified in Vergil’s Turnus.</p>

<p>V. discusses appropriateness of style (<i>decoro</i>) under the
seven <i>ideas</i> of Hermogenes (175), the nine <i>sensi</i>, and the
eight instruments.</p>

</div>

<p>We have also learned earlier in this confusion that art
not only comes from nature, but is a surer and more definite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
guide (35). Better take epithets from the ancient
poets than hunt for them (162). Orators must use common
speech; not so poets. Poetic diction should be not
only appropriate and sonorous, but remote from daily
speech (80).</p>

<p>Partenio’s main significance is the propagation of
Camillo’s doctrine of topics derived from Hermogenes<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
and transferred to poetic. Thus it exhibits the common
confusion both of poetic with rhetoric and of composing
with writing a theme. Its abundant examples are misapplied
to show how poetry may be brought on by dilation,
which belongs not to poetry, but to oratory. The whole
treatise might be called an art of dilation. It has hardly
anything to do with writing poetry, almost everything to
do with poetifying themes.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_9">9. SCALIGER</h3>

<p>Julius Caesar Scaliger achieved the longest Renaissance
Latin poetic (<i>Julii Caesaris Scaligeri viri clarissimi poetices
libri septem ...</i> 1561).<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Its complacency must have been
sometimes startling even to the Renaissance. The prefatory
letter to his son Sylvius is magisterial.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To this art we have applied the sanctions of philosophy,
which are the executives of all nature. That for lack of them
it has hardly been an art before us is evident from our discussion
(iii).</p>

<p>Horace, though he has written an “ars poetica,” teaches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
with so little art that almost the whole work seems nearer to
satire. The commentaries of Aristotle, as we have them, are
incomplete. The prudent Vida gives much good advice toward
making a poet more wary, but takes him as already accomplished
to lead him to perfection. We have led him by the
right way through all paths to the very end (iv).</p>

<p class="noindent">His learning is too large to be limited to the subject. “Not
to omit anything that makes for erudition” (170), he
inserts, for example, a long chapter (I. xviii) on dancing,

even from time to time autobiographical.</p>

sophistic topics (sex, occupation, moral habit, fortune, endowments,

<p>V. <i>Criticus</i> (17 chapters, 227 pages) is mainly a series
of comparative parallels (<i>comparationes</i>), first by authors
(Homer with Vergil, Vergil with Theocritus, etc.), then by
topics (691-717).</p>

<p>VI. <i>Hypercriticus</i> (7 chapters, 134 pages) is a review of
Latin poetry from the sixteenth century back.</p>

<p>VII. <i>Epinomis</i> (11 chapters, 47 pages) is an appendix.</p>

</div>

<p>Evidently the division overlaps; and the treatment involves
even further repetition. For the book is not a consecutive
treatise; it is rather a cyclopedia. Composed generally
in short chapters, it indicates the subject of each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
by a heading, and exhibits all the headings at the beginning
in a full table of contents. Thus its vogue may have
been mainly for reference. Since it is a guide, not an
anthology, the examples are usually brief. Longest naturally
in V, the book of parallels, they are elsewhere
sometimes only single lines, and rarely exceed ten. Though
the great exemplar is Vergil, who almost monopolizes
III and IV, they exhibit a wide range.</p>

<p>The object proposed is to form Latin poets: <i>poetam
creare instituimus</i> (200); <i>quoniam perfectum poetam
instituimus</i> (228). The book sets forth by precept and
example not only how to admire and criticize—and correct
even famous authors, but how to attain the company
of Latin poets, how to make Latin poetry. The history of
Latin poetry includes the sixteenth century, though not
the Middle Age. Latin poetry has been recovered; and
Scaliger, as one of its poets and one of its critics, shows
how it is to be carried forward. Surveying it up and down
its length, he gives much space to Claudian, Statius, and
Silius Italicus, corrects Horace and Ovid, rewrites Lucan
(849), estimates his own immediate predecessors. He is
a schoolmaster giving <i>praelectiones</i> and correcting Latin
themes, extending his instruction by summoning to his
desk all authors and all times. He has read everything.
Careful to quote the Greeks abundantly in Greek, he asserts
the superiority of the Latins. For one author only he
has nothing but admiration. His great exemplar, his
touchstone, is Vergil.</p>

<p>To pass from Scaliger’s views on individual poets and
poetic methods to his view of poetic as a whole is not easy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
and is no longer important. As to imitation, his lack of
specific precepts suggests that he has no consistent theory.
The Aristotelian idea, apparently accepted at the beginning,
is misinterpreted in the appendix. The usual Renaissance
advice to imitate only with hope of adding luster,
rhythm, or other charm (<i>lucem, numeros, venerem adiungere</i>,
700) refers, of course, to the other sort of imitation
and offers little guidance. On the other hand,
Scaliger laments his own early Ciceronianism (800), and
makes some acute incidental observations. The topics of
sophistic encomium in III, the stock comparisons in V.
xiv, and occasional use of terms throughout show the
usual Renaissance confusion of poetic with rhetoric.
Though in other passages Scaliger seems able to conceive
poetry in its own terms, he does not present poetic consistently
as a distinct art of composition. Indeed, what he
says about composition of either sort is often meager or
formal. His preoccupation, from lexicography to figures
of speech, is with style. The great apparatus for the production
of Latin poetry remains largely rhetoric.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_10">10. RONSARD AND TASSO</h3>

<p>Ronsard’s brief, hasty, and perfunctory <i>L’Art poétique</i>
(1565; reprinted, with five prefaces, Cambridge University
Press, 1930) shows the Pléiade preoccupation with
“enriching” the vernacular,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and applies the sophistic
recipe for encomium to the poet’s celebration of great
persons in odes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The true aim of a lyric poet is to celebrate to the extreme
him whom he undertakes to praise ... his race ... his native
place” ... (29). Enhancing his diction above common speech
(41-44), he will amplify, even dilate.</p>

<p>The terms <i>invention</i> and <i>disposition</i>, transferred conventionally
from rhetoric, do not open anything specific on composition.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Ronsard refers early to the relation of lyric to music. Except
for a few such references, he has been content to
gather commonplaces on style. The only importance of
the treatise is in showing one of the foremost sixteenth-century
poets driven, when asked for theory, as it were
inevitably to rhetoric.</p>

<p>Tasso’s poetic, on the other hand, is the most serious,
concise, and penetrative of the Renaissance. Composed
in 1568 and 1570 to be read before the Ferrara Academy,
the <i>Discorsi dell’arte poetica ed in particolare sopra il
poema eroico</i> were later amplified, in <i>Poema eroico</i> c.
1590 and <i>Discorsi dell’arte poetica</i>, 1587, for Tasso’s
theory was no less studious than his practice. Though he
too uses the headings of rhetoric <i>inventio</i> and <i>dispositio</i>,
he applies them to distinctively poetic conception and
poetic movement. For he discusses poetic specifically and
consistently as movement and as poetic movement. The
inspiration is the <i>Poetic</i> of Aristotle. Working independently,
Tasso grasped Aristotle’s animating ideas at about
the same time as Castelvetro in his illuminating commentary
(1570).<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The following references are to Solerti’s
edition of the <i>Discorsi</i> (1901).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The epic poet should move in his own Christian faith and
history, not among pagan deities and rites (12). His field
must not be too large (23-25); his narrative scheme (<i>favola</i>),
as Aristotle says, must be entire, of manageable scope, and
single (28). For unity (33), in spite of critical disputes, in
spite of Ariosto’s success without it and of Trissino’s failure
with it, is vital. Ariosto prevails (46) not through lack of
unity, but because of his excellence in other directions. Variety
(47) is desirable only if it does not risk confusion; and,
properly considered, it is compatible with unity. [A clear and
just rebuttal; there is no value in variety unless there is something
from which to vary.]</p>

<p>Part III (Style), opening with the rhetorical tradition of
the “three styles,” finds the third, <i>magnifico</i> (the Latin
<i>grande</i>), appropriate to epic (52). [Tasso’s own practice of
<i>magnifico</i> is neither florid nor dilated.] Ariosto’s style is
<i>medium</i>; Trissino’s, <i>tenue</i>. Tragedy (53), relying oftener on
specific words (<i>proprio</i>), is less <i>magnifico</i>; lyric is more
flowered and adorned; epic, though ranging between the two,
is normally <i>magnifico</i>.</p>

<p>Adding (55-60) a summary of the rhetoric of style, including
figures, Tasso finds Boccaccio’s prose over-rhythmical.
His appreciation of the force of exact words in Dante is refreshing
after the earlier disparagement. He closes with an
illuminating comparison (63) of epic style in Vergil with
lyric in Petrarch.</p>

</div>

<p>Even contributions so distinctive as these are less important
than the work as a whole. Tasso’s treatise is so
consecutive and so well knit as to be worth more than the
sum of its parts. Alike in his order and in his sentences
he is firmer and more severe than his time. These <i>Discorsi</i>
are carefully planned and adjusted for teaching. They
seek neither the conversational ease of Castiglione nor the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
seriatim analysis of Macchiavelli; and they are far removed
from the discursive suggestions of Montaigne.
They constitute a reasoned, consecutive poetic.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_11">11. SIDNEY</h3>

<p>Sidney’s <i>Defense of Poesy</i> (about 1583; edited by Albert
S. Cook, Boston, 1890) exhibits its moral function
from mere moralizing, through winsome teaching, to incitement
toward higher living.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The reminiscences of rhetoric are not accidental. Sidney
makes the usual Renaissance transfer to poetry of the traditional
threefold function of oratory: to teach, to delight, to
move (9, 11, 13, 22, 26). Toward the end (55) he apologizes.
“But what! methinks I deserve to be pounded [imprisoned]
for straying from poetry to oratory. But both have
such an affinity in the wordish consideration ...” [i.e., in
diction; but the main defect of the treatise is in leaving vague
the distinctive character of poetic composition].</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Moralizing, deviating to rhetoric, Sidney is nevertheless
suggestive and sometimes penetrative.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He cites Plato’s dialogues (3) as poetical. His lively account
of poetry as imaginative realization (4-6) and as insight
into human life makes clear Aristotle’s saying that
poetry “is more philosophical and more studiously serious
than history” (18). He satirizes Elizabethan ignoring of the
dramatic unities (48), and sees through Ciceronianism (53).
His section (55-56) on the character and capacity of English
verse, all too brief, has real importance.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">But he is so far from grasping Aristotle’s idea of imitation
that he renders it thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Poesy, therefore, is an art of imitation, for so Aristotle
termeth it in his word μίμησις, that is to say, a representing,
counterfeiting, or figuring forth; to speak metaphorically, a
speaking picture, with this end, to teach and delight (9).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">We leap away from Aristotle to Horace’s <i>ut pictura poesis</i>,
and so to rhetoric. This is not merely misinterpretation;
it indicates Sidney’s lack of any controlling poetic principle.
Though he tidily provides summaries at the ends
of his sections, he has little advance of thought. His work
is what it is called, a defense<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> of poetry, not a reasoned
theory.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is occasional significance in the usual Renaissance
array of names. Paying his respects to the Cardinals Bembo
and Bibbiena (44), Sidney immediately offsets them with the
Protestants Beza and Melancthon. He calls Fracastoro and
Scaliger “learned philosophers”; Pontano and Muret, “great
orators”; and refers twice to the Latin tragedies of George
Buchanan. His praise of l’Hospital (45) is probably reminiscent
of Ronsard’s ode; for Sidney is acquainted with the
Pléiade. Boccaccio, Petrarch, and Ariosto he merely mentions;
but he knows the greatness of Dante and of course the charm
of Sannazaro. Of the ancients, Plato is cited oftenest, then
Aristotle, Plutarch, Horace of course, and Pindar. He speaks
of “the height of Seneca’s style” (47), mentions Apuleius
(50), and cites the “Greek Romances” in an extraordinary
miscellany: “so true a lover as Theagenes, so constant a friend
as Pylades, so valiant a man as Orlando, so right a prince as
Xenophon’s Cyrus, so excellent a man every way as Virgil’s
Aeneas” (8). His review of English poetry (45-47) scorns
the intrusion of “base men with servile wits,” finds that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
Chaucer “did excellently”—for his time, and gives vague
praise to Surrey and Spenser. The reading of the English
gentleman poet has been wide, creditably classical, undiscriminating.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_12">12. ENGLISH DISCUSSION OF VERSE</h3>

<p>George Gascoigne’s <i>Certaine notes of instruction concerning
the making of verse or rime in English</i>, written
at the request of Master Edouardo Donati (1575; reprinted
in G. Gregory Smith’s <i>Elizabethan Critical Essays</i>,
I, 46-57) is a brief primer of English verse usage. Though
it bungles in detail, it is fairly true to the English tradition
of rhythm determined by stress.</p>

<p>The last years of the century prolonged in England a
proposal to classicize English metric. William Webbe’s
<i>Discourse of English Poetrie</i> (1586; Gregory Smith, I,
226-302. References are to these pages.) harps uncertainly
on classical prosody.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">What shoulde be the cause that our English speeche ...
hath neuer attained to anie sufficient ripeness, nay not ful
auoided the reproch of barbarousness in poetry? (227) ...
What credite they might winne to theyr natiue speeche, what
enormities they might wipe out of English Poetry ... if
English Poetrie were truely reformed (229).</p>

</div>

<p>A traditional preface on the origin of poetry leads from
divine inspiration through early bards to Ovid moralized,
Horace, and Mantuan (231-239). After dismissing medieval
rhymed Latin as “this brutish poetrie,” Webbe proceeds
to a review of English achievement.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I know no memorable worke written by any Poet in our
English speeche vntill twenty yeeres past (239).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>“Chawcer ... was next after [Gower].... Though the
manner of hys stile may seeme blunte and course to many
fine English eares at these dayes, yet ... a man shall perceiue
... euen a true picture of perfect shape of a right
poet.... Neere in time ... was Lydgate ... comparable with
Chawcer (241). The next ... Pierce Ploughman ... somewhat
harsh and obscure, but indeede a very pithy wryter ...
the first ... that obserued the quantity of our verse without
the curiosity of ryme” (242). A review of the sixteenth century
surrounds Surrey and Sidney with an array of second-rate
poets.</p>

<p>Taking a fresh start with the division into “comicall, tragicall,
historiall,” Webbe finds that Chaucer (251), even as
Horace (250), mingled delight with profit. After a vague
word for John Lyly (256) he returns to Golding’s translation
of Ovid (262). “Somewhat like, but yet not altogether
so poetical” is Chaucer, whom he seems to have on his conscience.
“But nowe yet at the last,” and comparable with the
best, is Spenser (263). A brief return to the ancients proceeds
from Hesiod through Vergil to Tusser and Googe
(265).</p>

<p>But Webbe still wishes that rhyme were not habitual.
“Which rude kinde of verse ... I may not vtterly dissalowe
[266]. I am perswaded the regard of wryters to this hath
beene the greatest decay of that good order of versifying which
might ere this haue beene established in our speeche” (274).
He even finds in English a “rule of position” (281), and
that <i>-ly</i> is short in adverbs, long in adjectives (282). Stubbornly
he closes his stupid book with an appendix (290):
“Heere followe the Cannons or general cautions of poetry,
prescribed by Horace, first gathered by Georgius Fabricius
Chemnicensis.”</p>

</div>

<p>Deaf to the tradition of English verse, Webbe is blind
to the development of English poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>Puttenham’s more pretentious <i>Arte of English Poesie</i>
(1589; reprinted in part by G. Gregory Smith, II, 1-193),
after the obligatory rehearsal of ancient seers, reads history
thus.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How the wilde and sauage people vsed a naturall poesie
in versicle and rime as our vulgar is” (chapter v); and “How
the riming poesie came first to the Grecians and Latins, and
had altered and almost spilt their maner of poesie” (chapter
vi). Classification into heroic, lyric, etc., and then into
comedy, tragedy, ode, elegy, etc., is followed (chapter xxxi)
by a review of English poetry as meager for a roll of honor as
it is undiscriminating in criticism.</p>

<p>Book II, Proportion Poeticall, is a misguided prosody.
“Proportion” is exhibited (chapter ii) in “staff” (i.e., stave
or stanza); (iii) in “measure” (i.e., feet) estimated by
the number of syllables without assigning a distinct function
to “accent”; (v) in caesura ranged with “comma, colon,
periodus,” terms transferred from rhetoric to serve as aspects
of rhythm; (vi and following) in “concord,” which includes
rime, accent, time, “stir,” and “cadence”; (xi) in “position”;
and finally in “figure,” square stanzas, triangles, ovals, suitable
to emblems and other devices. Through this confusion
and deviation the typical English stress habit glimmers so
faintly as never to be distinct. “How Greek and Latin feet
might be applied in English” (xiii) leads in the closing chapters
to “a more particular declaration of the metrical feet of
the ancient poets.”</p>

<p>Book III, Ornament, is a long and elaborate classification
of figures of speech.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It ends conventionally with typical
faults, with decorum, and, in tardy caution, with Horace’s <i>ars
celare artem</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>At the end of the sixteenth century, then, these Englishmen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
could still assume, with Ascham fifty years earlier,
that English poetry had no valid tradition of its own, still
seek to revive it by classicism. That classicism should be
not only revival of ancient stanza and imitation of ancient
style, as with the Pléiade, but even conformity to ancient
metric might rather have been proposed in France or Italy,
where vernacular verse had kept much of the Latin rhythmical
habit. In England, where the vernacular tradition
determined the verse pattern by the Germanic habit of
stress, the proposal was foredoomed as futile. The insistence
of the classical cult nevertheless lingers in serious
discussion. The correspondence of Gabriel Harvey with
Spenser on this point may be playful, or even partly
satirical; but Harvey was a fanatic, and even Spenser
sometimes read Chaucer’s verse strangely, sometimes in
his poetical youth made strange experiments. The item
that lingered longest in discussion, perhaps because it was
common to both verse traditions, is rhyme. Thomas Campion’s
<i>Arte of English Poesie</i> (1602)<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> attacked this specifically
and with more understanding of English rhythms
than Webbe had or Puttenham. Samuel Daniel replied
with a correct but feeble <i>Defence of Ryme</i> (1603).<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
Classicism could attempt to deviate English verse the more
easily when even poets and men of some learning did not
understand the linguistic development of their own
vernacular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_13">13. PATRIZZI</h3>

<p>Patrizzi’s poetic (<i>Della poetica di Francesco Patrici la
deca disputata ...</i> Ferrara, 1586) renews the quarrel with
Aristotle begun in his rhetoric.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The sub-title goes on: “in which by history, by arguments,
and by authority of the great ancients is shown the falsity of
the opinions most accepted in our times concerning poetic.
There is added the <i>Trimerone</i> of the same author in reply to
the objections raised by Signor Torquato Tasso<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> against his
defence of Ariosto.” The ten sections severally inquire: I concerning
poetic inspiration (<i>furore poetico</i>), II whether poetry
originated in the causes assigned by Aristotle, III whether
poetry is imitation, IV whether the poet is an imitator, V
whether poetry can be written in prose, VI whether plot
(<i>favola</i>) is rather distinctive of the poet than verse, VII
whether Empedocles as a poet was inferior to Homer, VIII
whether poetry can be made from history, IX whether ancient
poems imitated by harmony and rhythm, X whether the
modes of imitation are three.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The divisions obviously overlap, and there is confusion
in VII (152) between the origin of poetry and its essential
character, in VIII (168) between historical material
and history. Section VIII also misses the point of Aristotle’s
creative characterization for poetic consistency.
These misinterpretations, common enough at the time, are
due with Patrizzi to his missing Aristotle’s idea of imitation
as the distinctive poetic form of composition. Aristotle
thinking of composition remains dark or wrong to
Patrizzi thinking of style.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Thus he is typical of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
general Renaissance difficulty with Aristotle which came
from looking the other way. Even after Tasso and Castelvetro,
Renaissance poetic kept its preoccupation with style.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_14">14. DENORES</h3>

<p>Jason Denores, on the contrary, made his <i>Poetica</i> a digest
of Aristotle with a tabular view at the end of each
section (<i>Poetica di Iason Denores, nella qual per via di
definitione &amp; divisione si tratta secondo l’opinion d’Aristotele
della tragedia, del poema heroico, &amp; della comedia
...</i> Padua, 1588). The book has no critical grasp.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Section I (Tragedy) classifies characterization by types
(good rulers, bad rulers, etc.) and by the sophistic headings
for encomium. “Appropriateness of the traits of the tragic
personae consists in conformity (<i>decoro</i>) to age, emotion,
sex, country, profession” (folio 24, verso). In a word, it is
consistency. Chapter IX sums up what makes “una perfettissima
tragedia”; and the concluding chapter (X) exemplifies
an ideal tragic plot (<i>argomento</i>) by a novella of Boccaccio.</p>

<p>Section II (Epic) imposes the obligation of a single action
as against the <i>Achilleis</i> of Statius, the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid,
“and many of the romances of our time” (58). The <i>Aeneid</i>
has not one action (63) and is not so well extended (<i>distesa</i>)
as the <i>Odyssey</i> (66). Denores thinks that Aristotle intends
the same demands as to plot (<i>favola</i>, Chapter I) and even as
to component parts (Chapter VI) as for tragedy. Reviewing
as before in Chapter IX, he again demonstrates in Chapter X
by a story of Boccaccio.</p>

<p>Section III (Comedy) is merely an adaptation of the headings
for tragedy. Denores even makes bold to say: “But since
Aristotle seems to intend that the parts of comedy should be
as many as for tragedy, therefore we have for convenience
attributed to comedy prologue, episode, exode. The chorus we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
have not included, since in general it seems not to have been
used” (folio 138, verso). This section, too, is concluded by
a review and a demonstration from Boccaccio.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_15">15. VAUQUELIN</h3>

<p>The poetic of the Sieur Vauquelin de la Fresnaye is
important mainly for confirmation at the end of the century
(<i>L’Art poétique de Vauquelin de la Fresnaye, ou l’on
peut remarquer la perfection et le défaut des anciennes
et des modernes poésies</i>; text of 1605 edited by Georges
Pellissier,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Paris, 1885). Conceived in 1574 and embracing
the ideas of the Pléiade, it was still unfinished
in 1585 and finally published at Caen only two years before
the gentleman poet’s death. The latter part of the
sub-title refers to the addition of a sort of <i>catalogue raisonné</i>
of poets. Seventeen hundred and sixty Alexandrine
couplets survey poetry in three books as style and metric;
for composition enters rarely and in terms of rhetoric.
Though Aristotle is cited, the base is once more the “Ars
poetica” of Horace. Once more poetry is “speaking pictures”
(I. 226); once more the Pléiade repudiates <i>balades</i>
and <i>rondeaux</i> (I. 546). The doctrine of appropriateness
(<i>bienséance</i>, <i>il decoro</i>) indicates characterization by type
(II. 330; III. 499); and the ideal poetic combination is of
instruction with delight (III. 609, <i>utile-dulce</i>). Instead of
saying that Vauquelin outlived his age,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> we may rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
reflect that change in doctrine had been slow and was not
yet recognized generally.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VII_16">16. SUMMARY</h3>

<p>In the variety of these poetics appear certain habits
and tendencies significant of the period. First, the Renaissance
gentleman scholar finds it becoming not only to
write verse, especially Latin verse, but to discuss poetic.
Sound taste and informed judgment in poetry, as in
painting and sculpture, give him rank as accomplished.
The people assembled by Castiglione to discuss the ideal
courtier agree on this; and indeed several of them might
have written the dialogues examined above. Modern
readers impatient at the willingness to talk from the book
without independent thinking should beware of disparaging
the value of a general obligation to be informed
about poetry. But even the Renaissance gentlemen who
were in the stricter sense scholars seem content with learning
for itself. Instead of interpreting and advancing, they
exhibit.</p>

<p>The confusion about imitation is too general to be attributed
to the stupidity of individuals. It reflects the clash
of two conceptions: Aristotle’s idea of imitating human
life<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> by focusing its actions and speech in such continuity
as shall reveal its significance, an idea of composition; and
the humanist idea of imitating classical style. As ideas,
the two have nothing to do with each other; but they
tripped each other in fact. For the first was new, not yet
understood either exactly or generally; and the second was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
a widespread habit of thought. Imitation suggested classicism.
Aristotle, being an ancient, must in some way be
reconciled to this. Meantime it is evident, especially from
the more commonplace discussions, that though the theory
might not be clear, the practice inclined toward dilation
and borrowing. Ciceronianism, even while it waned, had
spread far beyond Cicero. Bembo’s imitation of Petrarch
was not a reproach; it was an added virtue.</p>

<p>The cult of the great period does not preclude citation
of Claudian, Statius, Silius Italicus; and Scaliger adds
Ausonius and Sidonius. Even Apuleius is not excluded;
and space is occasionally found for the dullness of Aulus
Gellius and Macrobius. The “Greek Romances” of
Achilles Tatius, Apollonius or Heliodorus find place not
only with Cinthio, Scaliger, and Vauquelin, but also with
Ronsard and Sidney. Indeed, those poetic habits summed
up in the term Alexandrianism and corresponding to the
decadent rhetoric called sophistic, crop out often enough
to suggest a considerable vogue. The sophistic recipe for
encomium is accepted by Ronsard; and there is common
approval, in doctrine as in practice, of parenthetical dilation
by descriptive show-pieces. So the rhetoric of Hermogenes,
embraced by Camillo and Partenio for poetic,
is mentioned elsewhere with respect. Alexandrianism is at
least an inclination of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>But the commonest sign of the times is the unabated
vogue of Horace’s “Ars poetica”. It is gospel as much to
the Renaissance as it had been to the Middle Age. The
cynical explanation would be its very shallowness and
conventionality; but probably the deeper reason is that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
Renaissance thinking on poetic, as Horace’s, was essentially
rhetorical. Here, at any rate, is the main significance
of these poetics. Various as they may be otherwise, they
have this in common. Tasso stands out as an exception,
in theory as in practice, by his clear view of poetic as a
distinct art of composition; and he is supported by Castelvetro’s
penetrative interpretation of the <i>Poetic</i> of Aristotle.
But Vauquelin has not heard them; and even Sidney,
though he sees the distinction, still falls back on rhetoric.
Even to the end of the sixteenth century, Renaissance
poetic was largely rhetoric.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">PROSE NARRATIVE</span></h2>

</div>

<h3 id="Chapter_VIII_1">1. TALES</h3>

<p>Nothing is more characteristic of the Renaissance
than the abundance of tales. Printed in large collections,
they evidently answered a steady demand; and they
furnished many plots for the Elizabethan stage. Often
significant of Renaissance taste in stories, they are generally
less interesting in narrative art.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_VIII_1a">(<i>a</i>) <i>Bandello</i></h4>

<p>Bandello dedicates each of his 224 <i>novelle</i> to some
friend in a prefatory letter which usually represents it
as actually told in his hearing by a person whom he names
(<i>Le quattro parti de le novelle del Bandello riprodotte
sulle antiche stampe di Lucca</i> [1554] <i>e di Lione</i> [1573]
<i>a cura di Gustavo Balsamo-Crivelli</i>, Turin, 1910). The
stories are further documented by proper names; or Bandello
tells us that he has substituted fictitious ones to shield
well-known families. <i>Novella</i> 16, for instance, of Part I
“happened last winter in this city of Mantua.” Though
this and many others are conventional <i>fabliaux</i> or stock
friar tales, they are all alike told for their news value, as
striking or exciting. Bandello seems more intent on finding
good stories than on making stories good. Hence he
is more significant of the appetite and taste of his time
than as a story-teller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>The Elizabethans, who often hunted in his collection,
often through French or English translations, created
from some of his persons characters as convincing as
Juliet and the Duchess of Malfi; but characterization rarely
detains Bandello himself. Since he may be content with
a mere clever retort or a dirty trick, many of his tales are
brief, and many of these are mere anecdote. Even so the
obligatory introduction summarizing the situation may
occupy a fourth, or even a third; and the rehearsal of the
facts may suffice without the salience that would give
them narrative interpretation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Novella</i> 9 of Part I in ten pages exhibits a husband so
jealous as to violate the confessional and thereupon murder
his wife. First displaying the luxury of Milan, the scene of
the story, and even pausing to comment on the Milanese
dialect, it proceeds to slow exposition of the situation, with
dialogue of minor persons not active in the story, and with
lingering over minor details. The only scene developed before
our eyes is the violated confession. Thus bungled, the ugly
story becomes more tedious than tragic.</p>

</div>

<p>Lack of salience, though not often so flagrant, is habitual.
Without salience, without sufficient motivation, Bandello’s
tales are oftener a mere series of events than a
sequence of scenes. They are not consistently developed
by action. Instead of revealing themselves progressively
before our eyes, his persons make speeches or even think
aloud. Their speeches are far oftener oratory than narrative
dialogue. Indeed, they may repeat what has been
already thought or done. The very inequality in the collection
betrays Bandello’s weakness in narrative composition.
His ornate style is fairly constant in elegant fluency;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
but his composition is hit or miss. He has no steady command
of story management.</p>

<p>Nor is his art sure in the eighteen longer tales. Of these,
twelve (Part I. 5, 17, 21, 34, 45, 49; Part II. 24, 28, 36,
40, 41, 44), averaging about twenty-three pages, have
essentially the same slack composition as the shorter tales.
The remaining six deserve more attention.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. 2 (26 pages) Ariobarzanes, proud and generous courtier,
endured from Artaxerxes a series of humiliations, and emerged
triumphant. The tale begins with the posing of a question:
is the life of a courtier essentially liberality and courtesy, or
obligation and debt? The series of trials is cumulative enough
to give a certain sequence; but that it involved a struggle
against detraction is not disclosed until the final oration, and
thus does not operate as motivation.</p>

<p>I. 15 (23 pages) Two clever wives conspired to outwit the
intrigues of their husbands, delivered them from prison, and
reconciled them to each other. Here are complication and solution,
but through a plot as artificial as it is ingenious. Though
the detail is livelier, the action is slow. It halts in the middle;
and the dénouement comes finally through a long oration rehearsing
the whole story in court. The only characterization is
of a third lady in the sub-plot.</p>

<p>I. 22 (25 pages) Timbreo, betrothed to Fenicia, repudiated
her through a dastardly trick of his rival. The lady, who was
supposed to be dead of shame, hid herself in a villa. The
rival repenting and confessing, both men vowed to set her
name right. At the request of her father marrying “Lucilla,”
Timbreo found her to be Fenicia. The rival married a sister,
and the King adorned the wedding with royal festivities,
dowries for the brides, and posts for the men. Here again
are complication and solution. Though some of the scenes are
realized, there is not that salience of critical situations which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
leads a narrative sequence onward. The royal wedding at the
end, for instance, has as much space as the repudiation.
Fenicia is presented with some hints of characterization.</p>

<p>I. 27 (27 pages) Don Diego and Ginevra, two very young
country gentlefolk, falling in love utterly at sight, the girl
turned so violently jealous as to deny all attempts at reconciliation;
and the boy in despair went far away to end his days
as a hermit in a cave. An old friend of both families, finding
his retreat, reasoned with him in vain, but roused his hope by
promising to move the girl. The girl was so far from being
moved that she planned to elope with an adventurer. The old
friend frustrated this and, in spite of the girl’s fury, carried
her off toward the boy’s cave. Her pride remaining quite obstinate,
the old friend finally lost patience and told her to go
her own foolish way; but the boy, coming to meet them,
showed so deep and unselfish devotion that she fell on his
neck. This tale, which Bandello had from Spain, has not only
complication and solution, but, in spite of some unnecessary
interruption, an engaging narrative progress. Besides the constant
motivation of the persons’ youth, there is definite characterization
of the old friend, of the boy, and especially of
the girl. No other tale of the collection equals this in narrative
composition.</p>

<p>II. 9 (35 Pages) The now familiar tale of Romeo and
Juliet is told straight through with little salience and with
little characterization.</p>

<p>II. 37 (48 pages) Edward III, suing a lady long in vain,
at last had to marry her. The lady’s first high-spirited and
intelligent response has some distinct characterization; but the
situation is repeated again and again with cumulative urgency
until this longest of the tales becomes tedious.</p>

</div>

<p>Even these better longer tales, then, are quite unequal
in story management. Bandello seems to take his stories
as he finds them. His literary fiction of writing a story that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
he has heard seems essentially true in that sense. As he
has not discerned in Boccaccio the various achievement of
a narrative artist, so he does not see what makes his own
best tales good, much less shape others accordingly. He
is not creative.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_VIII_1b">(<i>b</i>) <i>Marguerite de Navarre</i></h4>

<p>The collection of tales made by Marguerite de Navarre,
probably with her literary household, and now known as
the <i>Heptameron</i>, was first printed as <i>Les Amants fortunés</i>
in 1558. Obviously patterned on Boccaccio’s <i>Decameron</i>,
it uses the literary frame of an aristocratic house party
more realistically. The dialogue in comment on the stories
is developed to characterize each person. Thus the collection
is made a series of cases (<i>exempla</i>) for social comment.
But the tales themselves are inferior. Told simply,
without much flavor, “for fear” says the preface, “that
beauty of style might prejudice historical truth,” they are
usually lucid, somewhat conversational, often lax. There
is no mastery of narrative movement. The steadfast purity
of the wife is, indeed, a constant motivation in II. 3; but
the few salient scenes hardly constitute a sequence. The
mere series of events in III. 1 makes eighteen pages tedious
and ends in mere reversal. The dialogue of the retold
<i>Châtelaine de Vergi</i> (VII. 10; 20 pages) is oftener oratory
than narrative. The longest of the tales (I. 10; 32 pages),
a romance covering years, has so little salience that it
might as well have ended earlier. Most of the tales are
either anecdote or <i>fabliau</i> of about seven pages. Put forward
as actual, they are sometimes stock medieval tales,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
especially of the stupidity or brutality of friars, and where
they appear to narrate facts, sometimes merely report them
without realizing any moment as a scene. Boccaccio, too,
has simple anecdotes, in which all the charm is of style;
he too prolongs some of his stories without salience; but
among his many experiments are five <i>novelle</i> (I. 4, II. 1
and 2, VIII. 8, IX. 6) intensified by their sequence. Far
from noticing this difference, the writers of the <i>Heptameron</i>
show little awareness of narrative composition. The
accompaniment of discussion is better managed than the
stories themselves.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_VIII_1c">(<i>c</i>) <i>Giraldi Cinthio</i></h4>

<p>The collection <i>Hecatommithi</i> (hundred fables) of
Giovan-Battista Giraldi, known as Giraldi Cinthio,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> accumulated
through years. Begun apparently in his young
manhood, it had reached seventy tales in 1560,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> was
published in 1565, and reprinted in 1566, 1574, 1580,
and 1584.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> (<i>Hecatommithi, ouero cento nouelle, di M.
Giovanbattista Giraldi Cinthio</i>, nobile ferrarese: nelle
quali, oltre le diletteuole materie, si conoscano moralità
vtilissime a gli huomini per il benviuere, &amp; per destare
altresi l’intelletto alla sagacità; potendosi da esse con facilità
apprendere il vero modo di scriuere toscano ... 4th
edition, Venice, 1580.) Thus the moralizing suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
of the title is confirmed by the sub-title. Here are offered
one hundred—indeed, with the preliminary decade, one
hundred and ten—<i>exempla</i>. Nor is the collection made
less formidable by being classified: ten tales to exhibit
the superiority of wedded love, ten to show the risks of
dealing with courtesans, ten on infidelity, ten on chivalry,
etc. Nevertheless the tales are not all moralities, and in
some the moral is not even clear; for here once more are
both <i>fabliaux</i> and anecdotes. The frame is once more
Boccaccio’s. Young aristocrats, escaped from the sack of
Rome (1527), board ship and on a slow cruise entertain
one another with tales. The style, though sometimes slack
and diffuse, is not dilated for decoration. There is a leisurely
introduction; each tale is prefaced by comment on
the preceding; and each decade has an epilogue of discussion
and verse. The whole ends with a roll of fame
commemorating some hundred and fifty men of letters
in <i>terza rima</i>, and adding a list of eminent ladies.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Running generally from three pages to ten, the tales, even
the few that run to fourteen, remain scenario. II. ii. recounts
in fourteen pages a Persian tale of Oronte and Orbecche. V.
x. tells at the same length how the virtuous wife of Filogamo,
shipwrecked, resisted the Prince of Satalia, and that he was
thereupon expelled. In X. viii two quarreling nobles come to
blows, are imprisoned by King Louis, and subsequently reconciled
by the courtesy of one. Even the tale of the Moorish
captain, which has hardly more than eight pages, is not developed
narratively. Looking back to it from <i>Othello</i>, one
distinguishes the motivation discerned by Shakspere; but in
Giraldi’s tale this is either generalized or merely hinted; it
does not conduct the narrative.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>The composition, then, is generally scenario. If the
dialogue sometimes rises to narrative economy, it also becomes
sometimes mere oration. Character, often merely
typical, rarely suffices for motivation. Unnecessary spreading
of the time-lapse betrays a carelessness of focus. There
is no habit either of realizing scenes concretely in action,
or of conducting them in a sequence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A typical example is I. v. Pisti, condemned in Venice for
killing a man that had sought to debauch his wife, escaped
to Ferrara and was banned. The situation is first propounded,
and then recounted by his wife. She and his daughter being
left in poverty, he wrote anxiously, urging them to maintain
their honor. He was betrayed into captivity by two supposed
friends, that their father, who was also under Venice ban,
might by delivering him up reinstate himself. The father, refusing
to take advantage of their treachery, liberated Pisti on
condition that he forgive them. Pisti, returning secretly to
Venice, bade his wife denounce him to the Signory and claim
the reward for his head. She refused in an oration so fervent
as to attract the guard, who thereupon arrested him. Going
with him to court, she so told the whole story that the Signory
pardoned Pisti, restored his property, gave the reward to his
daughter for dowry, and even pardoned his false friends’
father. The motivation of an ingenious complication and solution
is all here—in the abstract. But the tale in eight pages
merely sums up or orates instead of realizing it in scenes.
The <i>novella</i> thus remains an <i>exemplum</i> of generosity, instead
of becoming a story of Pisti’s wife.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus Giraldi, seeking with Bandello news interest and
therefore melodrama, proposing an edification often quite
dubious, ignored the deeper narrative values. Reporter,
manipulator, moralizer, he is not a creator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<h4 id="Chapter_VIII_1d">(<i>d</i>) <i>Belleforest, Painter, and Fenton</i></h4>

<p>The collections of tales, then, show Renaissance story-telling
as a regression from the fourteenth century. The
narrative art of Boccaccio, to say nothing of Chaucer, has
suffered eclipse. Far from being advanced, it is not even
discerned. Renaissance story-telling is generally as inferior
as it is abundant. The few well managed stories stand out
in sharp relief against the mass of convention and of
bungling. But this is not all. Bandello’s tales as rendered
(1566-1576) in French by Belleforest and in English
through him by Painter and Fenton, are not merely translated;
they are dilated and decorated to the point of being
actually obscured as stories. Bandello’s forty-ninth tale,
already doubled by Belleforest, is trebled in Fenton’s first.
Livio and Camilla, told by Bandello in 1,500 words, has
nearly 11,000 in Belleforest’s twenty-second, and 16,731
in Fenton’s second. The dilation is by show-pieces of
description, by oratory, by moralizing, by allusions to
classical mythology and to the “natural” history derived
from Pliny, and by those balanced iterations known generically
in English as euphuism. Belleforest in his preface
(1568) begs the reader’s pardon for not “subjecting”
himself to the style of Bandello. “I have made a point,”
he says, “of recasting it.” His <i>Continuation</i> informs the
Duc d’Orléans in a dedication that he has “enriched with
maxims, stories, harangues, and epistles.” So Painter must
pause to describe.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There might be seene also a certain sharpe and rude situation
of craggy and vnfruictful rocks, which notwithstanding yelded
some pleasure to the Eyes to see theym tapissed with a pale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
moasie greene, which disposed into a frizeled guise made the
place pleasaunt and the rock soft according to the fashion of
a couerture. There was also a very fayre and wide Caue, which
liked him well, compassed round about with Firre trees, Pine
apples, Cipres, and Trees distilling a certayne Rosen or
Gumme, towards the bottom whereof, in the way downe to
the valley, a man might haue viewed a passing company of
Ewe trees, Poplers of all sortes, and Maple trees, the Leaues
whereof fell into a Lake or Pond, which came by certaune
smal gutters into a fresh and very cleare fountayne right
agaynst that Caue. The knight viewing the auncientry and
excellency of the place, deliberated by and by to plant there
the siege of his abode for performing of his penaunce and
life (Vol. III, p. 222, of the 1890 reprint).</p>

</div>

<p>Description for itself, without function, and even more
plainly the other habitual means of decoration, show not
only the general habit of dilation, but also the general
carelessness of narrative values. So is smothered even the
Spanish tale of Don Diego and Ginevra,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> which Bandello
had the wit, or the luck, to repeat in its original sequence.
Evidently these versions were looking not to composition,
not to the conduct of the story, but only to style.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_VIII_1e">(<i>e</i>) <i>Pettie, Lyly, and Greene</i></h4>

<p>William Pettie’s <i>A Petite Pallace of Pettie His Pleasure,
containing many pretie histories by him set forth in comely
colours and most delightfully discoursed</i> (1576) iterates
the medieval balance figures and reënforces them with alliteration.
Thus his rendering of the tale of Scylla and
Minos, after an expository summary and due moralizing,
presents:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">one Nisus, who had to daughter a damsel named Scilla, a
proper sweet wench, in goodliness a goddess, in shape Venus
herself, in shew a saint, in perfection of person peerless, but
in deeds a dainty dame, in manners a merciless maid, and in
works a wilful wench.... But to paint her out more plainly,
she was more coy than comely, more fine than well-favoured,
more lofty than lovely, more proud than proper, more precise
than pure.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">If there be any place for such style, surely it is not in story.
The story is hardly told; it is decorated, moralized, generalized
without narrative salience. The decoration thus
abused by Pettie became a vogue through John Lyly
(1553?-1606). His <i>Euphues, the Anatomy of Wit</i>
(1578) and <i>Euphues and His England</i> (1580) made the
<i>schemata</i> of sophistic, especially isocolon, parison, and
paromoion,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> a main item in the curious style called
euphuism.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Come therefore to me, all ye lovers that have been deceived

well endive to delight the people as hemlock to endanger the
patient, as well the rose to distil as the nettle to sting, as well
the bee to give honey as the spider to yield poison (Croll’s

ashes, show thyself sound when thou art rotten, let thy hue
be merry when thy heart is melancholy, bear a pleasant countenance
with pined conscience, a painted sheath with leaden
dagger (Ibid., p. 104).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The tiresome heaping of balances and allusions so cumbers
narrative that these books keep little semblance of story.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the habit was continued in the longer
English tales, sometimes called novels, of the 1580’s and
90’s. Greene’s <i>Carde of Fancie</i> (1584-1587) decorates
emotion with allusion and supplies balances by handfuls.</p>

the view of the Unicorne, and as he which drinketh of the
Fountaine Hipenis in Scithia feeleth his mind so drowned in
delight that no griefe, though never so great, is able to assuage
it, so, Gwydonius, I conceive such surpassing pleasure
in thy presence, and such heavenlie felicitie in the sight of
thy perfection, that no miserie though never so monstrous, is
able to amaze me, no dolour though never so direfull is able
to daunt me, nor no mishap though never so perillous is able
to make me sinke in sorrow, as long as I injoy thy presence,
which I count a soveraine preservative against all carefull
calamities.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is not necessary to regard this as quite serious to see
that balanced iteration and learned allusion had become
epidemic, and that both arise from the habit of dilation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
For even plain Thomas Deloney must decorate his clothier
Jack of Newbury (1597) with myth and marvel. That
such perversion of narrative, owing something now and
then, perhaps, to the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i> or to Apuleius, is
imitated more specifically from the Greek Romances is
plainest in Sidney’s <i>Arcadia</i>.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> It is one of the clearest
instances of Renaissance Alexandrianism.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VIII_2">2. RABELAIS</h3>

<p>Émile Egger was once moved to protest: “The actual
French usage of 1530 shows nowhere in either speech or
writing the diction of Rabelais.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Every student of Rabelais
will recognize this observation as a lead. It means
much more than the truisms that every eminent author
has his own style, and that study of style is the most constantly
fruitful study of literature. It means that Rabelais
makes the special demand of compelling attention always
to his style. His vocabulary<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> ranges from Latinizing to
dialect and jargon; his word-play from reckless puns to
various iteration; his cadences from the clausula of Cicero
to mere lists. His volubility flashes with picturesque concreteness.
He is popular, yes, but rarely in being simple,
usually in talking with his readers and in stimulating them
by extravagance. The fifteenth-century extravagance of
Skelton, showing a similar volubility, has less display.
Rabelais will not let us ever forget his style.</p>

le latin, et cuide ainsi pindariser; et luy semble bien
qu’il est quelque grand orateur en françois parce qu’il dedaigne
l’usance commun de parler.” A quoy dist Pantagruel, “Est il
vray?” L’escolier respondit: “Segnor missayre, mon genie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
n’est point apte nate à ce que dit ce flagitiose nebulon, pour
escorier la cuticule de nostre vernacule gallique; mais vice-versement
je gnave, opere, et par veles et rames je me enite de
le locupleter de la redondance latinicome.” “Par dieu,” dit
Pantagruel, “je vous apprendray à parler” (II. vi).</p>

</div>

<p>The parody is of that Latinizing “enrichment” of the
vernacular which was a wide preoccupation and the special
creed of the Pléiade. Rabelais, as Erasmus, ridicules its
paganizing. The larger satire is the rendering of the conventions
of student wildness in an iterative learned jargon.
For the iteration is not careless. Thus he prolongs a mere
play upon the word <i>Sorbonne</i>:</p>

<p class="noindent">Thus he prolongs a parody of legal citations.</p>

<p class="noindent">Thus the resolution of Diogenes to do his part in the
defense of Corinth lets Rabelais stop to amplify the commonplaces
of a siege.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">When Philip threatened siege, the Corinthians prepared for
defense. Some from the fields to the fortresses brought household
goods, cattle, wine, food, and necessary munitions.
Others repaired walls, raised bastions ... [and so through
a series of 25 predicates]. Some polished corselets [and so
through another catalogue of particulars]. Diogenes girt his
loins, rolled up his sleeves, gave his manuscripts to the charge
of an old friend [and so through another series of details]....
“Icy beuvant je delibere, je discours, je resouldz et concluds.
Aprés l’epilogue je ris, j’escris, je compose, je boy. Ennius
beuvant escrivoit, escrivant beuvoit. Eschylus (si à Plutarche
foy avez in <i>Symposiacis</i>) beuvoit composant, beauvant composait.
Homere jamais n’escrivit à jeun. Caton jamais n’escrivit
qu’aprés boire.” Thus the resolution gives occasion for eight
pages. (Prologue to Tiers Livre.) As here, the amplification
is often oratorical.</p>

</div>

<p>This various diffuseness, parody of Latinizing, legal
iteration, oratorical amplitude, is gift of gab, oral expansiveness,
passion for words; it is satire; and ultimately it
is search for a reading public. Taking his cue from the
almanacs and giant stories, Rabelais was exploiting the
grotesque. He was clever enough to see that he could
amuse not only the <i>bon bourgeois</i> who bought almanacs,
but also those who had some pretensions to studies. Both,
as Ariosto knew, found relaxation in the grotesque. The
latter would appreciate technical jargon more; but the
former would catch enough of its satire and get some
amusement from its very strangeness. Both he could feed
also with the marvels of voyages. For the grotesque is an
adult fairyland.</p>

<p>Rabelais takes us in and out of it, back and forth.
Though the work is largely narrative, it is not progressive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
story. The persons, often vividly realized at a given moment,
are not advancing to a destined issue. There is much
description, much discussion; and each has its effect rather
by itself than in a reasoned sequence. Thus the disgusting
story of the lady haunted by dogs, one of the most notorious
of his incidental <i>nouvelles</i>, is told quite as much for
its own shock as for any turn it gives to the larger story.</p>

<p>On the whole, Rabelais’ writing is <i>conte</i>, though usually
involving some exposition in aim and some actual comment.
The series of <i>exempla</i> and opinions as to whether
Panurge shall marry (III. xxi, seq.) reaches neither
a decision on the marriage nor a conclusion of character.
We find ourselves discussing the mendicant friars, listening
to a discourse on devils, and ending on sheer lore
about the herb Pantagruelion (III. xlix, seq.). All the
while the concreteness of the rendering is vivid in contrast
to the conventional generalities of the collections of tales.
The dialogue, instead of being exchange of orations,
sometimes flashes with narrative interaction. Rabelais takes
us traveling, as it were, through many excitements with
a group of voluble grotesques whose ideas are not developed
in sequences of paragraphs, nor their habits in
sequences of chapters. He opened both novel and essay
without achieving the form of either. For he was moving
toward that other kind of story and discussion which
ripened in journalism. Integration and continuity are less
important to attract readers than abundance and animation.
Instead of making a point, he often hovers around
it with many suggestions. Instead of giving a scene distinct
significance to lead into the next, he plays it with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
many overtones. Unsystematic as his various abundance
is certainly, and sometimes confusing, it must be recognized
as creative. Rabelais is not content merely to rehearse,
paraphrase, or decorate. Charged with various lore,
his work is never second-hand. What he seizes he
animates.</p>

<p>The satire of Rabelais, as distinct from his more descriptive
ridicule, is directed oftenest against pedantry.
The idea that he satirizes the Middle Age as an apostle of
Renaissance enlightenment extends a dubious contrast
beyond the evidence. For Rabelais is in some aspects
medieval. He was a wandering scholar, a <i>vagans</i>; he was
something of a <i>goliard</i>; and in the way of Godescalc he
was a <i>mauvais clerc</i>. His satire on monks and friars is
medieval literary stock. Indeed, it is much less attack, still
less reform, than excitement. Against medieval education
he does not urge Renaissance enlightenment except in
irony.</p>

<p>In a letter of June 3, 1532, he raised a disconcerting
question.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">How comes it, most learned Tiraqueau, that in the abundant
light of our century, in which by some special gift of the gods
we see all the better disciplines recovered, there are still found
everywhere men so constituted as to be either unwilling or
unable to lift their eyes from the more than Cimmerian darkness
of the gothic time to the evident torch of the sun?<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The irony of this is iterated and underlined in the oft-quoted
eighth chapter of his <i>Pantagruel</i>, where Gargantua
recalls his youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">As you may easily understand, the times were not so suited,
so convenient for literature, as the present, and had few such
teachers as you have had. The times were still dark, and still
exhaled the awkwardness and ill luck of the Goths, who had
destroyed all good literature. But by divine goodness light and
dignity have been restored to literature in my time; and I see
such improvement that at present I should hardly be received
in the beginning class, though as a man I used to be reputed
the most learned of my time. I say this not in vain boasting,
though I might legitimately do so in writing to you (see
Marcus Tullius <i>De senectute</i> and Plutarch in the book entitled
<i>How to praise oneself without reproach</i>), but to show you
my deep affection.</p>

<p class="noindent">Nowadays all the disciplines have been restored, the languages
reëstablished: Greek, without which ’tis a shame for any one
to call himself learned, Hebrew, Chaldee, Latin; printed editions
as elegant as correct in usage, which were invented in
my time by divine inspiration, as artillery by suggestion of the
devil. The whole world is full of scholars, of most learned
teachers, most ample libraries; and it seems to me that neither
the time of Plato nor that of Cicero offered such convenience
for study as is seen now. Hereafter we need not find in office
or in society any one unpolished by the shop of Minerva. I
see brigands, executioners, adventurers, stableboys of today
more learned than the doctors and preachers of my time. Nay
more, women and girls have aspired to that praise and celestial
manna of good instruction.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">What is pierced here is not medieval ignorance, but
Renaissance complacency. The pedantry that Rabelais satirizes
is of both ages. His quarrel with the Sorbonne of
his own day may have been edged by the banning of
<i>Pantagruel</i>. The book was banned as obscene. It is obscene.
Let us no longer pretend that he attacked obscurantism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
as a champion of enlightenment. For whatever his
motive, Rabelais remained singularly detached. He was
far from being an apostle of enlightenment, or of anything
else.</p>

<p>Yet he is still cited in some histories as forecasting
modern education. An educational theory has been extracted
from him, even a scheme. To support this, his
conventional or picturesque ridicule of university teaching
and of student manners is at most negative. A positive
contribution has been found in his abbey of Thelème
(I. lii-lviii).</p>

<p>Thelème, the ideal abbey that is the scene of the so-called
scheme of education, takes its name probably from
that preposterous allegory <i>Hypnerotomachia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> wherein
the hero forsakes the guidance of Reason (Logistica) for
that of will (Thelemia). Its architecture and landscape
gardening, again reminding of Colonna’s pseudo-classical
elaboration, receive, with the furniture and accessories, ten
times as much space as the studies. It has 9,332 suites.
Its library abounds in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, French,
Tuscan, and Spanish (omitting English and German);
and its frescoes are of “antiques prouesses.” Outside are
fountains, a hippodrome, a theater, swimming pool, garden,
labyrinth, tennis court, and park. Inside it is supplied
with costumers and furnishers. Its community of men
and women, all handsome, richly dressed, and commanding
the six languages well enough to compose in prose
and verse, has no community obligation. Living in luxury,
with the six languages among their pastimes, freed from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
the world and from all duties to one another, these privileged
souls have for their community device “Fais ce
que voudras.”</p>

<p>The humor of this, which ought to be discernible even
to those preoccupied with schemes of education, might
more easily be taken to imply that irresponsibility plus
command of languages is not a sufficient educational formula
even in an ideally luxurious environment. Since this
would be a shrewd satire on the Renaissance, it may well
be what Rabelais meant. Certainly he did not mean to
propose Thelème for adoption as an idea, much less as a
scheme. Do as you please, provided you live in luxury
and command six languages. Is that an educational idea?
Is it by any tenable interpretation an educational scheme?
To range Rabelais with such pioneers of the fifteenth century
as Guarino and Vittorino, or with such coming leaders
as Vives and Loyola, is not only to misinterpret him;
it is to do him wrong. His satire is not limited to the loud
and boisterous; he is master also of irony. Let Thelème
rest as he left it, an ironical fantasy.</p>

<p>Nor should Gargantua’s studious day (I. xxiii), no hour
unfilled, no subject neglected, be called a program of
education.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Rabelais must have been aware that for educational
reform he had no warrant. Whatever else may be
laid to his charge, he was not pretentious. His own education,
interrupted, never carried through in any field, but
widely ranging, gave him not a system, but a singularly
various fund. His reputation for scholarship, recently
urged, is hardly borne out by the few contemporary compliments.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
Rather their fewness and their vagueness, in a
period of mutual admiration among scholars, suggest that
he was less famous than he has been made to appear. He
was not Latinist enough to detect the fabrication of the
so-called <i>Will of Lucius Cuspidius</i>, which he published
in 1532.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> His Greek, extending to the translation of certain
well-known Greek works of medicine,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> may have
been fortified by previous Latin translations. His knowledge
of law is vouched by his abundant use of legal terms,
evidence rather of his friendship with lawyers and his
appetite for jargon. He knew medicine enough to be house
physician at the Lyon Hôtel Dieu and personal physician
in the suite of the Cardinal du Bellay. Certainly this is
evidence, almost the only specific evidence, of his achievement
in learning. But it should not imply that he was a
scientist. At most he did not advance the narrow limits
of the medicine current in his time. He was an acceptable
practitioner in a period of prolonged ignorance.</p>

<p>But such generalizations are less suggestive than what
has been laboriously pieced together of his very meager
chronology. In 1530 he was matriculated in medicine at
the University of Montpellier. In 1532 he was practicing
medicine at Lyon and publishing the Latin letters of the
Italian physician Manardi, the <i>Aphorisms</i> of Hippocrates,
the fabricated Cuspidius, and his own <i>Pantagruel</i>. This in
two years. Within the two years preceding 1530 it is suggested
that he may have studied law at Poitiers and visited
other universities. Even if the suggestion could be brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
to the dignity of an inference, what would it guarantee
of learning? Except for a single undated letter from the
priory of Ligugé, we have no documentation on Rabelais
from 1521 to 1530. But if indeed he did study law at
Poitiers and did visit other universities before he turned
to medicine, or if he picked up some medicine on the way,
then he was superficially experimenting toward versatility.
The issue is sometimes dodged by calling him a humanist.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
But though he had humanist friends, he was obviously
not a classicist. Or again, his learning, because his
allusions are astonishingly various, is called encyclopedic.
As a compliment to learning, the adjective is dubious; but
in another sense it is suggestive of his intellectual curiosity
and his acute awareness of words. Knowing that
there is much to be learned, as Dr. Johnson said, from the
backs of books, he was alert to pick up a little of everything.
He found that for his new readers bits of lore had
the interest of news. While they liked his samples of
learning and relished his satire on the pedantries of humanism,
the humanists, seeing more in the joke, relished
it none the less. It was gay, but also thoughtful, escape
from the solemn Renaissance fictions of classicism. Rabelais
already knew his readers well enough to carry them
wine on both shoulders.</p>

<p>The insistent and various extravagance anticipated
journalism in that it was the cultivation of style as advertisement.
Besides perennial excitements of substance
he uses dialect, slang, jargon, parody, oratory, not in
ebullience, not in occasional outbreak, but in constant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
parade of style. He is a sensationalist; his readers are to
be shocked and amused. So he turned to the grotesque,
and so he pursued it. He has no winsome persons; his
satire has no indignation; his laughter, no sympathy. In
this aspect a most suggestive contrast is offered by Cervantes.
“Cervantes laughed Spain’s chivalry away” is unjust
because it is shallow. From the beginning and
throughout, <i>Don Quixote</i> thrives on what Rabelais precludes,
geniality. The grotesque of Cervantes is human
enough to make us feel a certain social service beyond
laughter in attacks on windmills; and his great achievement
is the creation of a grotesque whom we come to
love.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_VIII_3">3. HISTORY</h3>

<p>History straddles the fundamental division of composition
into the forms of discussion or persuasion on the
one hand and, on the other, those of story or play. For
history is now one, now the other, and now both together.
Earlier chronicles, more or less epic, hardly discuss at all;
some recent histories are so bent on analysis as hardly to
narrate at all; and some of the greater histories, ancient
or modern, Thucydides, Tacitus, Macchiavelli, bring the
two into effective combination. In any age this last is so
difficult as to demand superior grasp. Livy, for instance,
being generally content with narrative, hardly makes even
his imaginary orations to troops expository. But Thucydides,
narrating effectively, is no less concerned to
instruct his readers in the issues. His “Expedition against
Syracuse” thus became both tragedy and sermon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<h4 id="Chapter_VIII_3a">(<i>a</i>) <i>Latin Histories</i></h4>

<p>The fifteenth century shows the advance of history
beyond chronicle in the Latin of Leonardo Bruni, of
Arezzo (1369-1444; <i>Leonardi Aretini historiarum florentini
populi libri XII</i>, Florence, 1855-1860, 3 vols., ed.
by Mancini, Leoni, and Tonietti, with the Italian translation
of Donato Acciajuoli). Chronicles nevertheless persisted;
for they still had, perhaps still have, the values
realized by Herodotus. But Bruni undertook and fairly
accomplished something more: “history, which in so many
simultaneous events must keep the longer sequence, explain
the causes of single facts, and bring out the interpretation”
(I. 52). Not quite Thucydides or Tacitus,
perhaps, he has clearly moved in their direction. His style
is periodic in habit without often conforming strictly,
humanistic without being laboriously imitative or diffuse,
intelligently Ciceronian without being inhibited by Ciceronianism.
The orations inserted after the fashion of Livy
show, indeed, that he felt bound to such amplitude, variety,
and classical allusion as should climb the high style; but
they are neither frequent nor conventionally decorative,
and some of them are both lively and urgent pleas. The
following examples are typical.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Book III: Pope Gregory to the Florentines for peace through
the restoration of the exiles; and the Florentine speech of refusal.</p>

<p>Book IV: Ianus Labella for insuring the republic against
the pride of the nobles.</p>

<p>Book VI: Debate of the Perugian envoys with the Florentines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>Book VIII: The Florentine envoys to the Pope; the Pope’s
reply and Barbadoro’s indignant rejoinder.</p>

<p>Book XII: The Milanese legates at Venice against the
Florentines, and the Florentine reply.</p>

</div>

<p>Bruni puts orations oftenest into the mouths of envoys
to develop issues which he has already summarized. Generally
they are terser than the speeches of the fashionable
dialogues; and sometimes, for he had often been an envoy
himself, they are warm with actual debate. In this way
his narrative is interpreted by exposition. Remaining narrative
in plan, it indicates the animating considerations
and interprets the outcome.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Book I, for instance, closes a summary of ancient history
with a survey of Italian cities after the invasions, and Frederick
II’s fatal widening of the breach between Empire and
Papacy. Book II shows Florence in full republican career
thwarted by factions; Book IV, the creation of the <i>vexillifer
justitiae</i> as a republican means of checking the selfish ambitions
of the nobles. The increasing use of mercenaries shown
in Book VII leads to chronic difficulties detailed later. The
last three books present the war with Milan not only in its
succession of events, but also as a single enterprise.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Finishing his first book in 1416, his sixth in 1429, Bruni
solemnly presented nine books to the Signory in 1439,
and lived to finish his long labor before 1444.</p>

<p><i>De bello italico adversos gothos gesto historia</i> (1441),
an amplification of the summary in the first book of his
History of Florence, has less interpretation. The steady,
concise narrative, with little comment, has sometimes too
little salience. But to attentive reading the story of battle
after battle, now victory, now defeat, gradually gives some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
grasp of the military operations to hold Italy for Justinian.
The main figure is Belisarius. Except in occasional concrete
description, this history is more like Caesar’s, and
is an experiment in that expository narrative later mastered
by Macchiavelli. Belisarius is clearly exhibited not
only as marvelous in military science, but as an intelligent
organizer and administrator. When he feels himself let
down by Justinian, and is approached by the Goths toward
a joint kingdom, he will not commit himself to any disloyalty.
His triumphal return to Justinian reports his
intelligent discipline in Italy. Later his recall to Italy after
other generals had meantime failed finds the task of
reorganization hopeless in the disaffection of the imperial
soldiers so long unpaid and ill led. With very little comment
or review Belisarius emerges clearly from the narrative
itself.</p>

<p>Bruni’s histories are evidence of a sober earlier humanism
immune to the extravagances of Ciceronianism and
to that allusive display that led to dilation. They go about
their business. Oratory is kept subsidiary to the story and
the message. This tradition of Latin history continues in
the <i>Scotorum historiae</i> (1526) of Hector Boece, and again
in the <i>Rerum scoticarum historia</i> (1582) of George Buchanan.
Both wrote Latin history seriously as European
scholars. Buchanan, sometimes arid and partisan, was nationalist,
indeed, only in his later years. Meantime he had
taught for many years in France, had written Latin tragedies,
and had been saluted by Joseph Scaliger as the
foremost of Latin poets. History, then, kept alive among
the humanists the medieval tradition of international<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
Latin. Its classicism, more restrained and more intelligent,
less of style than of method, was the more valid imitation.</p>

<h4 id="Chapter_VIII_3b">(<i>b</i>) <i>Vernacular Histories</i></h4>

<h5>MORE</h5>

<p>Sir Thomas More’s study of Richard III (<i>The History
of King Richard the Thirde ... Writen by Master Thomas
More ... 1513</i>, ed. J. R. Lumby, Cambridge, 1883) shows
these preoccupations in both Latin and English. Though
it is unfinished, it is not fragmentary, nor merely descriptive;
it is a thoroughgoing interpretation. All the more
conspicuous, therefore, is its concrete vividness. Though
judge and afterward pamphleteer, More cast this history
as story. He makes us understand largely by making us
see. Thus the Queen surrenders her son.</p>

<p>More’s diction is discreetly popular, both choice and
homely, pointed with proverbs, occasionally reminiscent
of popular poetry.</p>

<p class="noindent">The management of sentences is less expert. More, as
many other humanists, was bilingual to the extent of
composing habitually in Latin even when he meant to
publish in the vernacular. <i>Richard III</i> he composed in
both. This may partly explain his frequent use of what
are now subordinating conjunctions to begin sentences.
<i>Wherefore</i> is often used in sixteenth-century English, as
Latin <i>quare</i>, where modern use requires <i>therefore</i>. But
when allowance is made for this, there still remains some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
uncertainty as to sentence boundaries, some doubt as to
whether an added clause is subordinate or independent.
Writing racy English for the larger audience, More tolerated
the looser aggregative habit of English prose in his
time. But his English, as well as his Latin, shows clear
grasp of the period, and even occasional strict conformity.
Current English still lagged in this respect throughout the
century. Before Hooker English prose is generally less
controlled than Italian. On the other hand, More uses
balance and epigram discreetly, not for decorative display,
but strictly for point; and his shifting from longer aggregations
to sharp short sentences gives pleasant variety.</p>

<h5>MACCHIAVELLI</h5>

<p>Narrative and exposition are perfectly fused in Macchiavelli
(<i>Istorie fiorentine, testo critico con introduzione e note
per cura di Plinio Carli</i>, Florence, Sansoni, 1927, 2 vols.).
His history of Florence (1532) not only has an insistent
moral; it is at once narrative and expository. While we
see the events, we see into them. His analytic narrative
carries the orator’s art of <i>narratio</i>,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> the statement of the
facts involved in an argument, to greater scope. We follow
Macchiavelli not merely as assenting to his conclusions,
but as reaching them ourselves. The more
distinctively narrative values of vividness and directness
he brings out often enough to show his control. But his
ultimate object is not imaginative realization; it is rather
persuasion. The sequence is not only of events, but of
ideas. The admirable orations given to leaders at crises
are not merely conventional, nor mainly to characterize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
the speaker as a person in a play, but to expound the
situation. Livian in model, they are oratory of a higher
order, both acutely reasoned and persuasive.</p>

<p>Macchiavelli’s exposition is sometimes separate, as in
the essay that prefaces each book, or in those <i>sententiae</i>
that from time to time open vistas of thought.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Beyond doubt rancor seems greater and strokes are heavier
when liberty is recovered than when it is defended (II. xxxvii.
123).</p>

<p>For a republic no law can be framed which is more vicious
than one that looks to the past (III. iii. 136).</p>

<p>No one who starts a revolution in a city should expect
either to stop it where he intends, or to regulate it in his own
way (III. x. 148).</p>

<p>Between men who aspire to the same position it is easy to
arrange alliance, but not friendship (VI. ix. 34).</p>

<p>For men in power shame consists in losing, not in crooked
winning (VI. xvii. 81).</p>

<p>Thereupon arose in the city those evils which oftenest
spawn in a peace. For the young, freer than usual, spent immoderately
on dress, suppers, and such luxuries, and being
idle, wasted their time and substance on gaming and women.
Their study was to appear splendid in dress, sage and astute
in speech; and he who was quickest with biting phrase was
wisest and most esteemed (VII. xxviii. 155).</p>

<p>Force and necessity, not written promises and obligations,
make princes keep faith (VIII. xxii. 198).</p>

</div>

<p>But most of his exposition is not added; it is welded.
The narrative itself is made expository by a constant chain
of cause and effect. It is clear both in its events and in their
significance for policy. We learn at every turn not only
what Florence did, but why; and we forecast the result.
Stefano Porcari, lamenting the decay of the Church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
(VI. xxix. 101), is inspired by Petrarch’s “Spirto gentil.”
The account of the conspiracy nipped by the Pope is rather
a story plot than a story. Macchiavelli is content to suggest
that it was operatic. He is not concerned to work out its
story values; he is bent on its historical significance. The
spectacles at the wedding of Lorenzo to Clarice (VII. xxi.
148) are not elaborated descriptively; they are summed
up as indicative of the habit of the time. So is handled
(VII. xxxiii. 162) Professor Cola Montano’s doctrinaire
enthusiasm for republics and scorn of tyrants. His pupils
find the issue in assassination. The splendid audience of
the Pope (VIII. xxxvi. 218) to the ambassadors of Florence
for reconciliation is at once description and argument.
Thus the progress of the <i>Istorie fiorentine</i> is simultaneously
of facts and of ideas. It is analyzed narrative.</p>

<p>Fused also is the style. Heightened for the orations
(II. xxxiv; III. v, xi, xiii, xxiii; IV. xxi; V. viii, xi, xxi,
xxiv; VI. xx; VII. xxiii; VIII. x), it is never decorated,
never diffused, so ascetically conformed to its message as
never to obtrude. This is not negatively the art that knows
how to conceal itself, but positively the art that is devoted
singly. True in the choice of words, it is expert in the
telling emphasis of sentences. Its reasoned balances suffice
without the empty iteration of English euphuism. They
are played never for display, always for point. The Latin
period, welcome to the habit of Macchiavelli’s mind, is
rarely pushed to a conformity that would in the vernacular
have seemed artificial. Macchiavelli’s sentences are in
logic fifty years ahead of the French and the English; but
they do not force his own vernacular.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="Chapter_IX_1">1. DISCUSSIONS ON POLITICS AND SOCIETY</h3>

<p>Two Italian books of the early sixteenth century became
so famous as to be almost proverbial. Written
about the same time, Macchiavelli’s <i>Principe</i> (1513) and
Castiglione’s <i>Cortegiano</i> (1514) are complementary.
Macchiavelli expounds princely policy in war and in the
truces between wars; Castiglione leads princely leisure
into culture. The policy and the culture are parts of the
same Italian world; but the two books are in sharpest
contrast. Macchiavelli’s facts are strictly analyzed; Castiglione’s
are habitually idealized. Macchiavelli’s style is
stripped and so fused with the message as to be inseparable;
Castiglione’s is ample, manipulating the decorative
diffuseness of its time and its setting to elegance. Macchiavelli’s
economy is insistent, urgent; Castiglione’s is
gracious, deliberate, suggestive, rising to oratory. Both
men used their thorough control of Latin to shape their
writing of Italian prose; but Macchiavelli was applying
rather such compression as that of Tacitus, Castiglione
the composition of Cicero.</p>

<p>It is Macchiavelli’s triumph that consideration of his
doctrine has quite submerged his style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I have not adorned nor distended this book with ample
cadences, nor with precious or magnificent words or any other
extrinsic charm or ornament, such as many are wont to use
for descriptive decoration; for I have wished that nothing
might win it praise, in other words that it should be acceptable
only for the truth of its matter and the gravity of its subject
(Dedication to Lorenzo).</p>

<p>Since my object is to write something useful to him who
understands it, I have thought it more fitting to follow rather
the effectual truth of the thing itself than its concept [immaginazione]
(Opening of xv).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">His name soon became a byword; for Englishmen and
Frenchmen found it easier to denounce Italian statecraft
than to explain wherein their own was different. Formulated
for Italian despots, his doctrine that the safety and
independence of the state are paramount over any consideration
of justice or mercy became more and more
sinister in terms of the rising new national monarchs
beyond his ken. In the composition of the whole Macchiavelli
was still young. He had not yet achieved the
sure control felt in his <i>Istorie fiorentine</i>. Masterly already
in expository analysis, eloquent in its close, the <i>Principe</i>
has not a compelling logical sequence.</p>

<p>In sequence and in detail the <i>Cortegiano</i> is more mature
than Macchiavelli’s <i>Principe</i>. Castiglione kept it by him
ten years. The final revision (Codex Laurentianus, Rome,
1524) was published at Florence in 1528. All this care
left the diction unpretentious. Scholarly without pedantry,
Castiglione even forestalls the Tuscans by openly proclaiming
his right to Lombard words. “I have written in
my own tongue, and as I speak, and to those who speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
as I do.” Thinking often of rhetoric, feeling the Latin
period and attentive to <i>clausula</i>, he applies his lore to
Italian sentences without stiffness or formality, happily
reconciling gravity with ease. Encomium, inevitable in his
subject and his time, is oftener implied than dilated.
The plan of the dialogue is taken from Cicero’s <i>De
oratore</i>. Reminiscence in detail is negligible. Castiglione’s
imitation is not the common Renaissance borrowing of
passages; it is the adaptation of Cicero’s plan for presenting
the typical Roman statesman to survey of the
typical Italian. Thus the dialogue is Ciceronian in proceeding
logically from point to point. Within the frame
of Cicero the conduct of the book expands the dialogue
toward conversation. This is not dramatic dialogue; nor
is it imitation of the Platonic quest. Rather Castiglione’s
intention was to realize the human scene, to flavor the
point with the speaker; and his achievement in suggesting
the gracious interchange of the court of Urbino has
been found quite as significant as the conclusions of his
debates.</p>

<p>For the <i>Cortegiano</i> is one of the few Renaissance books
that have endured the test of time. Details of place and
time have been made to carry so much larger human
suggestion that it has been reprinted again and again; it
has been widely translated; it has today an audience not
only of special students, but of the many more who love
literature. Though the very term “courtier” is obsolete,
though the particular social function soon faded, the book
endures. It is not only the best of Renaissance dialogues;
it is a classic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Utopia</i> (1516) of Sir Thomas More, beginning as
a dialogue on certain social evils in England, passes to
descriptive exposition of a state organized and operated
solely for the common weal. Though the name <i>Utopia</i>
means “nowhere,” this polity is described as the actual
experience of a returned traveler. The literary form is
thus reminiscent of Lucian, whom More ten years before
had translated with Erasmus. It is reminiscent also of Plato,
of the travelers’ tales popular in that age of discovery
and explanation, and more faintly of those distant or
fortunate isles (<i>îles lointaines</i>) which had often been
posed as abodes of idealized communities. But though
these hints were doubtless intended, they are incidental.
They fade as we read on.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for More’s literary reputation, most of
us read his best-known book only in a pedestrian translation
(Ralph Robinson, 1551; second edition, 1556).
Keeping much of the vivacity of the diction, this is quite
unequal to More’s flexible Latin rhythms.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> For More, as
for Poliziano and Leonardo Aretino, Erasmus and Buchanan,
Latin was a primary language. But whereas
Erasmus had, so to speak, no effective vernacular, More’s
literary achievement in English is both distinguished in
itself and ahead of his time. In spite of some uncertain
ascriptions, we may be fairly sure that the English version
of his <i>Richard III</i>,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> as well as the Latin, is his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>Continued discussion of the prince and the state moved
Sir Thomas Elyot (1490?-1546) to make an English
compilation for the widening circle of readers, <i>The
Governour</i> (1531, ed. H. S. Croft, London, 1883,
2 vols.). “I have nowe enterprised,” he says in a proem
to Henry VIII, “to describe in our vulgare tunge the
fourme of a juste publike weale, whiche mater I have
gathered as well of the sayenges of moste noble autours
(grekes and latynes) as by myne owne experience.” But
the “governour” and the “juste publike weale” receive no
consistent discussion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The opening chapters, postulating <i>order</i>, proceed thence to
<i>honour</i> (i.e., rank), and so to <i>one sovereign</i>. Their review of
history is very slight; and from Chapter iv Book I is occupied
rather with the education of a gentleman. Book II is composed
mainly of <i>exempla</i> to illustrate the virtues appropriate
to high position; and Book III adds little more than further
classified aggregation.</p>

</div>

<p>With no further design, without even a distinct idea,
<i>The Governour</i> has of course no logical progress. Lawyer
and something of a diplomat, Elyot was not a thinker.
Reading widely without discrimination, and sometimes
apparently at second hand, he compiled under headings.
His later <i>Bankette of Sapience</i> (second edition? 1542) is
a collection of <i>sententiae</i> arranged alphabetically under
abstinence, adversity, affection, ambition, authoritie, amitie,
apparaile, almsdeede, accusation, arrogance, etc. His
<i>Governour</i>, though its headings have more logic, is hardly
consecutive. In sources as in topics the book is a miscellany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. vii, viii, for instance, on a gentlemanly, not a professional
knowledge of music, painting, and sculpture, suggest the
<i>Cortegiano</i>; xii inquires “why gentilmen in this present time
be not equal in doctryne to the auncient noblemen”; xiv proposes
<i>exempla</i> for law students. After finding England deficient
in the fine arts (140), he returns to law students with
a recommendation of rhetoric, and thereupon itemizes it (149)
under <i>status</i>, <i>inventio</i>, etc. By the end of the book he has
passed from prudence to chess, archery, tennis, and bowls.</p>

</div>

<p>Elyot’s diction, though he wishes to “augment our
Englysshe tongue,” is Latinized sparingly. <i>Copie</i> in the
sense of the Latin <i>copia</i>, was fairly common in his time.
He adds, e.g., <i>allecte</i> and <i>allectyve</i>, <i>coarted</i>, <i>fatigate</i>,
<i>fucate</i>, <i>illecebrous</i>, <i>infuded</i>, <i>propise</i>, and <i>provecte</i>. His
generally unpretentious habit is sometimes concretely
racy.</p>

<p>Jean Bodin’s treatise on historical method (<i>Methodus
ad facilem historiarum cognitionem</i>, 1566),<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> giving high
praise to Guicciardini, differs from him in conception.
For Bodin, history is less a progress in time than a
thesaurus of <i>exempla</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Dividing it into human, natural, and divine, he would have
us begin with a chronological reference table (ii), proceed to
a more detailed survey, such as Funck’s or Melanchthon’s,
advance to the histories of particular nations, Jews, Greeks,
Romans, and then to such smaller communities as Rhodes,
Venice, and Sicily, with constant attention to geography.</p>

<p>In iii, <i>De locis historiarum recte instituendis</i>, the topics
are first the commonplaces of encomium: birth, endowments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
achievements, morals, culture. From the family, which for
Bodin is the starting point of history, we are to proceed to
the organization of the state and the developments of the arts.</p>

<p><i>De historicorum delectu</i> (iv) has many specific and acute
estimates of both ancients and moderns. “Somehow those who
are active in wars and affairs (44) shy at writing; and those
who have given themselves somewhat more to literature are
so possessed with its charms and sweetness as hardly to think
in other terms.” Bodin himself is broad enough to praise both
Plutarch and Tacitus.</p>

<p><i>De recto historiarum iudicio</i> (v), beginning with geography,
proceeds to regional traits. The approach is suggestive; but
the development is little more than aggregation under those
dubious headings Northern and Southern, Eastern and Western.</p>

<p>At this point (vi) Bodin begins the analysis of the state:
the elemental family, the citizen, the magistrate, the king.
“Macchiavelli, indeed, the first after some twelve hundred
years since the barbarians to write on the state, has won general
currency; but there is no doubt that he would have written
several things more truly and better if he had added legal
tradition (<i>usus</i>) to his knowledge of ancient philosophers
and historians” (140). Monarchy is found to be the ideal
form of government. The golden age of primitive peace and
happiness is proved to be a senile fancy (vii). Let us rather,
relying on the science of numbers, <i>De temporis universi
ratione</i> (viii), compute the recurrence of historical “cycles.”
Strange conclusion to so much hard reasoning!</p>

</div>

<p>Systematically analytical, the book is easier to consult
than to follow; but its Latin style is of that sincere, capable,
unpretentious sort which had been established for
history by the Italians. The political ideas of the <i>Methodus</i>
are carried out by the same systematic analysis in Bodin’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
second book, <i>Les Six Livres de la république</i>, 1576.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
Greek and Latin political usage is made by a long wall of
citations to support, with other proofs from history, the
theory of absolute monarchy.</p>

<p>Such support of the new monarchies by a reasoned
theory based on ancient history did not pass unchallenged.
George Buchanan, with more literary competence in Latin,
though with less knowledge of politics, offered for his
little Scotland a theory of monarchy answerable to the
people (<i>De jure regni apud Scotos dialogus</i>, 1579).<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The
preface, addressed to James VI, keeps a tutorial tone, as
of one still laying down the law. The occasion put forth
for the Ciceronian dialogue is French reprobation of
Scotch politics. How shall this be met? The method is
evident from the first three points.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To distinguish a king from a tyrant, we must remember that
society is founded not only on utility, but on natural law implanted
by God. A king is typically shepherd, leader, governor,
physician, created not for his own ends, but for the welfare
of his people (1-6).</p>

<p>Kingship, being an <i>ars</i> based on <i>prudentia</i>, needs guidance
by laws (8). Objection: who would be king on these terms?
Answer: ancient history and doctrine show motives higher
than lust for power and wealth (9).</p>

<p>These two points being iterated in summary for transition,
the third is the need not only of laws, but of a council (11-14).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>The many <i>exempla</i> from ancient and modern history
confirming or challenging the <i>a priori</i> progress of the
dialogue do not touch the recent events that raised the
question. Scotch history is used even less specifically than
ancient to confirm the theory of limited monarchy. But
though Buchanan does not prove that recent politics were
an application of his theory, he makes the theory itself
interesting and sometimes persuasive.</p>

<p>The Latin style has more liveliness, expertness, and
range than Bodin’s. But the argument, though urgent as
well as scholastically ingenious, remains unconvincing.
After debating general considerations inconclusively, it
falls back at last on the particular customs and needs of
Scotland. These are not applied specifically enough to be
determining. The expertness of the dialogue is rather
literary than argumentative.</p>

<p>Brought down to the market place by printing, controversy
by the end of the century was learning the ways of
journalism in pamphlets. Meantime printing had opened
such compilation as Elyot’s, samples of learning for those
eager readers who had not gone to school with the Latin
manuals of Erasmus.</p>

<p>The best of these sixteenth-century discussions, the
piercing urgency of Macchiavelli, the charming exposition
of Castiglione, the philosophical survey of More, the
systematic analysis of Bodin, the hot attack of Buchanan,
are all essays in that modern sense of the word which
applies it to consecutive exposition involving argument.
They show essay-writing of this kind—which was to move
more surely in the seventeenth century—already on a firm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
footing. They recognize the Italian tradition of history
in abjuring the decorative dilation which was habitual in
other fields. They show Latin and vernacular side by side,
and vernacular prose gaining point and finish from the
Latin commanded by all their writers. They are a solid
literary achievement of the Renaissance.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter_IX_2">2. MONTAIGNE</h3>

<p>The other kind of essay, the literary form that has kept
the original meaning of attempt, sketch, experiment, had
its pace set late in the sixteenth century by Montaigne.
Nothing could be farther removed than his habit from tidy
system or consecutive argument. Devoted to the reading
of history, and eager to share its profits, he had no mind
to follow the Italian tradition of writing history. <i>Essai</i>
in his practice is not the settling of a subject, but the
trying. He makes one approach, then another, suggesting
relations that he does not carry out. With many <i>exempla</i>
he invites us to accumulate philosophy of living. If we
do not coöperate, if we do not think them over, his
essays remain collections of items in memorable phrase,
without compelling sequence of ideas. For Montaigne is
not the kind of philosopher who integrates a system; he
is a sage. He has the sage’s oral habit. No writing conveys
more the impression of thinking aloud. Again and again
he writes as if making up his mind, not before utterance,
but by the very process of utterance. Macchiavelli, or
Bodin, having made up his mind fully and finally, tries
to convince us; Montaigne, as if making up his in our
company, throws out suggestions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>True, some few of his essays are more consecutive
developments of what he has concluded. His early and
widely quoted <i>Education of Children</i> (II. xxvi) has even
some logical progress.</p>

<p>But logical sequence is not Montaigne’s habit. His
many revisions<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> show him leaning more and more on the
aggregation of separate suggestions. He changes words,
he adds instances, but he does not seek a stricter order.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>But I am going off a little to the left of my theme.... I,
who take more pains with the weight and usefulness of my
discourses than with their order and sequence, need not fear
to lodge here, a little off the track, a fine story (II. xxvii).</p>

<p>This bundling of so many various pieces is made on condition
that I put hand to it only when urged by too lax a
leisure, and only when I am at home (II. xxxvii, opening).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">His usual lack of sequence, then, is not careless. The careless
fumbling that comes from muddled thinking he
ridicules.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>They themselves do not yet know what they mean, and you
see them stammer in bringing it forth, and judge that their
labor is not in childbirth, but in conception, and that they are
only licking what is not yet formed (I. xxvi).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">As to sequence he even catechizes himself.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Is it not making bricks without straw, or very like, to build
books without science and without art? The fantasies of
music are conducted by art, mine by chance.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And his answer is very earnest.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>At least I have this from my course of study (<i>discipline</i>),
that never a man treated a subject that he understood and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
knew better than I do the one that I have undertaken, and
that in this subject I am the most learned man alive; secondly,
that no one ever penetrated farther into its material, nor
peeled more sedulously its parts and their consequences, nor
reached more precisely and fully the end that he had proposed
for his job. To accomplish this, I need bring no more
than fidelity. That I have, the most sincere and pure that is
to be found (III. ii).</p>

</div>

<p>Montaigne’s method, then, is deliberate.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> If he passes,
as in <i>Des coches</i> (III. vi), from examples of lavish display
to the cruelty of Spanish conquest in Mexico and
frankly begins his last paragraph with <i>retumbons à nos
coches</i>, that is because he usually prefers to take us on a
journey around his idea. Hundreds of readers have found
the talk of such a guide on the way more winsome than
the conclusions of others after they have come home.</p>

<p>The art of growing an idea by successive additions sets
the pace also for his sentences. Knowing Latin, he tells
us, as a native language, and better than French, he puts
aside Cicero for Seneca. This is more than the rejection
of Ciceronianism, more than preference for Seneca’s philosophy;
it is in detail the same aggregative method that
he uses for the composition of a whole essay. That vernacular
sentences were commonly more aggregative than
those of Augustan Latin may have been a reason for his
choosing the vernacular. At any rate, he keeps the two
languages quite apart. Instead of applying his Latin to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
the pointing of his French sentences, he prefers to let
them accumulate as in talk.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) They do still worse who keep the revelation of some
intention of hatred toward their neighbor for their last will,</p>

<p>(2) having hid it during their lives,</p>

<p>(3) and show that they care little for their own honor,</p>

<p>(4) irritating the offense by bringing it to mind,</p>

<p>(5) instead of bringing it to conscience,</p>

<p>(6) not knowing how, even in view of death, to let their
grudge die,</p>

<p>(7) and extending its life beyond their own. (I. vii.)</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The sentence might easily have been recast in a Latin
period; Montaigne prefers to let it reach its climax by
accumulation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) Nature has furnished us, as with feet for walking, so
with foresight to guide our lives,</p>

<p>(2) foresight not so ingenious, robust, and pretentious as
the sort that explores (<i>invention</i>),</p>

<p>(3) but as things come, easy, quiet, and healthful,</p>

<p>(4) and doing very well what other people say,</p>

<p>(5) in those who have the knack of using it simply and
regularly,</p>

<p>(6) that is to say, naturally. (III. xiii.)</p>

</div>

<p>So his epigrams are comparatively few and simple. His
many memorable sayings are not paraded as <i>sententiae</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is not a soul, not a body, that we are educating; it is a
man (I. xxvi).</p>

<p>Unable to regulate events, I regulate myself, and adjust
myself to them if they do not adjust themselves to me (II.
xvii).</p>

<p>The teaching that could not reach their souls has stayed on
their lips (III. iii).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>Between ourselves, two things have always seemed to me
in singular accord, supercelestial opinions and subterranean
morals (III. xiii).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">For Montaigne’s shrewd summaries prevail less often by
balanced sentences than by concrete diction.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I am seldom seized by these violent passions. My sensibility
is naturally dense; and I encrust and thicken it daily by discourse
(I. ii).</p>

<p>Anybody’s job is worth sounding; a cowherd’s, a mason’s, a
passer-by’s, all should be turned to use, and each lend its
wares; for everything comes handy in the kitchen (I. xxvi).</p>

</div>

<p>Such sentences, such diction, are not only his practice;
they are part of his literary theory.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The speech that I like is simple and direct, the same on
paper as on the lips, speech succulent and prompt (<i>nerveux</i>),
curt and compact, not so much delicate and smoothed as
vehement and brusque—<i>Haec demum sapiet dictio quae feriet</i>—rather
tough than tiresome, shunning affectation, irregular,
loose, and bold, each bit for itself, not pedantic, not scholastic,
not legal, but rather soldierly (I. xxvi).</p>

<p>The urgent metrical sentence of poetry seems to me to soar
far more suddenly and strike with a sharper shock [The
figure is of a falcon] (I. xxvi).</p>

<p>These good people (Vergil and Lucretius) had no need of
keen and subtle antitheses. Their diction is all full, and big
with a natural and constant force. They are all epigram, not
only the tail, but the head, the stomach, and the feet....
It is an eloquence not merely soft and faultless; it is prompt
and firm, not so much pleasing as filling and quickening the
strongest minds. When I see those brave forms of expression,
so vivid, so deep, I do not call it good speaking; I call it good
thinking (III. v).<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>So he cannot stomach that Renaissance imitation which
ran to borrowing, nor that display of Latin style for itself
which published even private letters.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Those indiscreet writers of our century who go sowing in
their worthless works whole passages from the ancients to
honor themselves (I. xxvi).</p>

<p>But it surpasses all baseness of heart in persons of their
rank that they have sought to derive a principal part of their
fame from chatter and gossip, even to using the private letters
written to their friends (I. xl).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">So he is impatient with the unreality of romance.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Going to war only after having announced it, and often
after having assigned the hour and place of battle (I. v).</p>

<p>Those Lancelots, Amadis, Huons, and such clutter of books
to amuse children (I. xxvi).</p>

</div>

<p>Reviewing contemporary criticism of poetry, he says:
“We have more poets than judges and interpreters of
poetry; it is easier to make it than to know it” (I. xxxvii).
“You may make a fool of yourself anywhere else,” he
warns, “but not in poetry” (II. xvii). So there is no
room for mediocre poetry.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Popular, purely natural poetry has simplicities and graces
comparable with the eminent beauty of poetry artistically perfect,
as is evident in the Gascon villanelles and in songs
brought to us from illiterate peoples. Mediocre poetry, which
is neither the one nor the other, is disdained, without honor
or even esteem (I. liv).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Dismissing in a scornful phrase “the Spanish and Petrarchist
fanciful elevations” (II. x), he exactly estimates
the Latin poets of his time as “good artisans in that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
craft” (II. xvii). Perhaps a certain significance, therefore,
attaches to his repeating the current complacency
with regard to French poetry.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I think it has been raised to the highest degree it will ever
attain; and in those directions in which Ronsard and Du
Bellay excel I find them hardly below the ancient perfection
(II. xvii).</p>

</div>

<p>Elsewhere, and habitually, Montaigne’s attitude toward
the classics was quite different from the habit of the
Renaissance. He sought not so much the Augustans as
Seneca and the Plutarch of Amyot.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Je n’ay dressé commerce avec aucun livre solide sinon Plutarque
et Seneque, où je puyse comme les Danaides, remplissant
et versant sans cesse (I. xxvi).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">These, and even Cicero and Vergil, he sought not for
style, but for philosophy and morals. That sounder
classicism of composition which, through the Italian
tradition of history, had animated Renaissance essayists
of the stricter sort he put aside. He was not interested in
the ancient rhetoric of composition, nor, to judge from
his slight attention to it, in that field of ancient poetic.
He quotes both Dante and Tasso, but not in that aspect.
He is not interested in the growing appreciation of
Aristotle’s <i>Poetic</i>. In this disregard of composition, indeed,
he was of the Renaissance; but he rejected and even
repudiated Renaissance pursuit of classicism in style.
There he adopted the sound doctrine of Quintilian and
scornfully, to use his own word, abjured borrowed plumes
and decorative dilation. If we use the word classical in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
its typical Renaissance connotation, we must call Montaigne,
as well as Rabelais, anti-classical. Unlike as they
are otherwise, they agree in satirizing Renaissance classicism.</p>

<p>The positive aspect of this rejection is Montaigne’s
homely concreteness. Trying to teach his readers, not to
dazzle them, he is very carefully specific. To leave no
doubt of his meaning, he will have it not merely accepted,
but felt. Therefore he is more than specific; he is concrete.
Imagery for him is not mythology; it is of native
vintage.</p>

<p>“In this last scene between death and us there is no
more pretending. We have to speak French; we have to
show how much that is good and clean is left at the bottom
of the pot” (I. xix). Such expression strikes us not as wit,
not as an aristocrat’s catering to the new public, but as
the sincere use of sensory terms to animate ideas. If it reminds
us sometimes of popular preaching, that is because
Montaigne was a sage.</p>

which is the common refrain. The other lines have generally five
beats, but the sixth and eleventh have only three; and this variation
is occasionally extended. Generally there is a rhyme-shift after the
eleventh line, but not a break (11 lines on 5 rhymes [or 4] plus 7
lines on 3 rhymes [or 4]). A few stanzas are lengthened to nineteen
lines (11 plus 8). Thus the typical variations in this triumph of
metrical interweaving are as follows, the underlined letters indicating
the lines of three beats:</p>
